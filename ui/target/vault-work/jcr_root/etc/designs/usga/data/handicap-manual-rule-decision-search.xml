            Section 1 PURPOSE, AUTHORIZATION, and LICENSING 
          Definitions
          Within each section, all defined terms are in italics and are listed alphabetically in Section 2 - Definitions.
          
            1-1. Purpose
          The purpose of the USGA Handicap System is to make the game of golf more enjoyable by enabling players of differing abilities to compete on an equitable basis. The System provides a fair Course Handicap for each player, regardless of ability, and adjusts a player's Handicap Index up or down as the player's game changes. At the same time, the System disregards high scores that bear little relation to the player's potential ability and promotes continuity by making a Handicap Index continuous from one playing season or year to the next. A Handicap Index is useful for all forms of play, and is issued only to individuals who are members of a licensed golf club.
          Two basic premises underlie the USGA Handicap System, namely that each player will try to make the best score at every hole in every round, regardless of where the round is played, and that the player will post every acceptable round for peer review. The player and the player's Handicap Committee have joint responsibility for adhering to these premises.
          A Handicap Index, issued by a golf club or authorized golf association (through its member clubs), indicates a player's skill and is a number taken to one decimal place, e.g., 10.4. 
          A Handicap Index compares a player's scoring ability to the scoring ability of a scratch golfer on a course of standard difficulty. A player posts scores along with the appropriate USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating to make up the scoring record. A Handicap Index is computed from no more than 20 scores plus any eligible tournament scores. It reflects the player's potential because it is based upon the best handicap differentials posted for a given number of rounds, ideally the best 10 of the last 20 rounds.
          A Handicap Index is portable from course to course, as well as from one set of tees to another set of tees on the same course. A player converts a Handicap Index to a Course Handicap based on the Slope Rating of the tees played.
          A USGA Course Rating is the USGA's mark that indicates the evaluation of the playing difficulty of a course for a scratch golfer under normal conditions based on yardage and other obstacles that affect scoring ability. A Slope Rating is a measurement of the relative difficulty of a course for players who are not scratch golfers. Each course is rated from each set of tees for both the scratch golfer and the bogey golfer. The USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating together reflect the difficulty of the course for a player who is not a scratch golfer. The greater the difference between the scores of the scratch and bogey golfers on a certain course, the higher the Slope Rating will be and the more strokes players will receive. Conversely, the less the difference, the lower the Slope Rating will be and the fewer strokes players will receive.
          Each player locates the Handicap Index on the appropriate Course Handicap Table and finds the corresponding Course Handicap. A Course Handicap Table can be found in the clubhouse or near the first tee of a golf course. There will be a Course Handicap Table for each set of tees used by men and by women. The number of strokes a player receives (Course Handicap) is based upon the relative difficulty (Slope Rating) of the course.
          Use of this manual, which provides a detailed description of all aspects of the USGA Handicap System, will make all competitions more enjoyable.
          
            Section 1-2 - Authorization and Licensing
          An authorized golf association or golf club must obtain a license from the USGA in order to utilize the USGA Handicap System, to use the USGA marks, and to issue a Handicap Index. Only an authorized golf association may issue a USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating. If a golf club or authorized golf association does not follow all of the procedures of the USGA Handicap System, it is not permitted to use any part of the System or to refer to any handicap that it issues or certifies as a "Handicap Index," "Short Course Handicap," or as a handicap authorized by the USGA. (See Decisions 1-2/1, 1-2/2.)
          In countries outside the United States, this written authorization must be in place with the authorized golf association before a golf club within the association's geographic jurisdiction can use the USGA Handicap System.
          Only a golf club or an authorized golf association that utilizes the USGA Handicap System in full accordance with the USGA Handicap System as described in The USGA Handicap System manual may use USGA trademarks and service marks.
          More than one hundred authorized golf associations, and several thousand golf clubs, utilize the USGA Handicap System and issue a Handicap Index.
          Policies of a golf club or an authorized golf association must be consistent with "The Rules of Golf" and "The USGA Handicap System." An essential element is the requirement that each golf club must have a Handicap Committee to ensure the integrity of the USGA Handicap System. A golf club must use the USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating issued by an authorized golf association. 
          The following terms are trademarks and service marks of the United States Golf Association: "Bogey Rating&amp;trade;,""Course Handicap&amp;trade;," "Course Rating and Slope Database&amp;trade;," "Equitable Stroke Control&amp;trade;," "ESC&amp;trade;," "Handicap Differential&amp;trade;," "Handicap Index&amp;reg;," "The USGA Handicap System Licensing Program for Clubs&amp;trade;," "Hole-by-Hole Stroke Allocation Analysis Program&amp;trade;," "Home Course Handicap&amp;trade;," "Short Course Handicap&amp;trade;," "USGA Short Course Rating&amp;trade;," "SLOPE&amp;reg;," "Slope Rating&amp;reg;," "Slope System&amp;reg;," "Trend Handicap&amp;trade;," "United States Golf Association&amp;reg;," "USGA&amp;reg;," "USGA Course Rating&amp;trade;," "USGA Course Rating Program&amp;trade;," "USGA Course Rating System&amp;trade;," and "USGA Handicap System&amp;trade;." 
          Any organization that is not a licensed golf club or an authorized golf association, and individual players who are not members of a golf club, may not use these marks or any part of the USGA Handicap System, including the USGA's mathematical handicap formula, except to the extent that they provide products or services to authorized golf associations or golf clubs for the limited purpose of following the USGA Handicap System. The USGA will make certain that those who are authorized to use USGA trademarks and service marks do so in a manner that preserves the integrity and reliability of the USGA Handicap System. As owner of those well-established trademarks and service marks, the USGA has the sole right to authorize the use of those marks by others.

            Active Season
          An "active season" is the period during which scores made in an area will be accepted for handicap purposes determined by the authorized golf association having jurisdiction in a given area.
          
            Adjusted Gross Score
          
            An 
            
              "adjusted gross score"
            
             is a player's 
            
              gross score
            
             adjusted under 
            
              USGA Handicap System
            
             procedures for unfinished holes, conceded strokes, holes not played or not played under the Rules of Golf, or 
            
              Equitable Stroke Control
            
            . (See Section 4.)
          
          
            Authorized Golf Association
          An "authorized golf association" is a not-for-profit entity that is recognized as having exempt status under Section 501 (c) of the United States Internal Revenue Code and has been licensed by the USGA to utilize the USGA Handicap System and/or the USGA Course Rating System within a certain state or region. It is an organization comprised of golf clubs or golfers, operated under bylaws, and in existence for the purpose of supporting USGA core programs and services for amateur golfers, and otherwise promoting the best interests and preserving the true spirit of the game of golf. See minimum requirements to be licensed by the USGA in the United States as an authorized golf association, which can be viewed on the USGA website at www.usga.org. 
          
            Bogey Golfer
          A male "bogey golfer" is a player who has a Course Handicap of approximately 20 on a course of standard difficulty. He can hit tee shots an average of 200 yards and reach a 370-yard hole in two shots at sea level. A female bogey golfer is a player who has a Course Handicap of approximately 24 on a course of standard difficulty. She can hit tee shots an average of 150 yards and reach a 280-yard hole in two shots. 
          
            Bogey Rating
          A "Bogey Rating" is the USGA's mark of the evaluation of the playing difficulty of a course for the bogey golfer under normal course and weather conditions. It is based on yardage, effective playing length, and other obstacles to the extent that they affect the scoring ability of the bogey golfer. 
          
            Course Handicap
          A "Course Handicap" is the USGA's mark that indicates the number of handicap strokes a player receives from a specific set of tees at the course being played to adjust the player's scoring ability to the level of scratch or zero-handicap golf. For a player with a plus Course Handicap, it is the number of handicap strokes a player gives to adjust the player's scoring ability to the level of scratch or zero-handicap golf. A Course Handicap is determined by applying the player's Handicap Index to a Course Handicap Table or Course Handicap Formula. (See Section 10-4.) A player's Course Handicap is expressed as a whole number. The result of any conditions of the competition, handicap allowance, or competition from a different USGA Course Rating that changes a Course Handicap is considered to be the Course Handicap.
          
            Course Handicap Table
          A "Course Handicap Table" is a chart that converts a Handicap Index to a Course Handicap based on the Slope Rating for a specific set of tees. 
          
            Course Rating (See USGA Course Rating.)
          
            Differential, Handicap (See Handicap Differential.)
          
            Eligible Tournament Score
          An "eligible tournament score" is a tournament score made either within the last 12 months or within the player's current 20-score history.
          
            Equitable Stroke Control (ESC)
          
            
              "Equitable Stroke Control"
             (ESC) is the downward adjustment of individual hole scores for handicap purposes in order to make handicaps more representative of a player's potential ability. ESC sets a maximum number that a player can post on any hole depending on the player's Course Handicap. ESC is used only when a player's actual or most likely score exceeds the player's maximum number based on the table in Section 4-3.
          
            Golf Association
          
            See authorized golf association.
          
          
            Golf Club
          A "golf club" is an organization of at least ten individual members* that operates under bylaws with Committees (especially a Handicap Committee) to supervise golf activities, provide peer review, and maintain the integrity of the USGA Handicap System (see Club Compliance Checklist, Section 8-2m and Decision 2/7). A golf club must be licensed by the USGA to utilize the USGA Handicap System. A club can obtain a license directly from the USGA or in conjunction with its membership in an authorized golf association that is already licensed by the USGA and that has jurisdiction in the geographic area that includes the principal location of the golf club. (See Appendix F.)
          *For administrative reasons, some authorized golf associations may require a golf club to have more than the USGA minimum of ten members in order for the golf club to be a member of the authorized golf association.
          Members of a golf club must have a reasonable and regular opportunity to play golf with each other. They must be able to return scores personally, and these scores must be readily available for inspection by others, including, but not limited to, fellow members and the club's Handicap Committee.
          A golf club is one of three (3) Types:
          Type 1. The members of a Type 1 club are located at a single specific golf course with a valid USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating where a majority of the club's events are played and where the club's scoring records reside; or
          Type 2. The members of a Type 2 club are affiliated, or known to one another, via a business, fraternal, ethnic, or social organization. The majority of the club members had an affiliation prior to organizing the club; or
          Type 3. The members of a Type 3 club had no prior affiliation and a majority of the recruiting and sign up of the membership is done by solicitation to the public (e.g., newspaper, Internet).
          
            
              Note
            : Within the context of the USGA Handicap System a member is defined as one who is affiliated with a licensed golf club for the purpose of obtaining a Handicap Index.
          
            Gross Score
          A "gross score" is the number of actual strokes plus any penalty strokes taken by a player. (See adjusted gross score.)
          
            Handicap Allowance
          A "handicap allowance" is the percentage of the Course Handicap recommended for a handicap competition. Allowances vary for different forms of competition and are designed to produce equitable competitions. (See Section 9-4.)
          
            Handicap Committee 
          A "Handicap Committee" is the Committee of a golf club that ensures compliance with the USGA Handicap System, including peer review. A majority of the Handicap Committee, including the chairperson, must be members of the club; club employees may serve on the Handicap Committee, but an employee may not serve as chairperson.
          
            Handicap Differential
          A "Handicap Differential" is the difference between a player's adjusted gross score and the USGA Course Rating of the course on which the score was made, multiplied by 113, then divided by the Slope Rating from the tees played and rounded to the nearest tenth, e.g., 12.8.
          
            Handicap Index 
          A "Handicap Index" is the USGA's service mark used to indicate a measurement of a player's potential ability on a course of standard playing difficulty. It is expressed as a number taken to one decimal place (e.g., 10.4) and is used for conversion to a Course Handicap. (See Section 10.)
          
            Handicap-Stroke Hole
          A "handicap-stroke hole" is a hole on which a player is entitled to apply a handicap stroke or strokes to a gross score. (See Sections 9-3a and 17.)
          
            Handicap Type
          Throughout this manual, different types of handicaps are identified by letter designations. Each "handicap type" is identified as follows:
          L = Local handicap 
          M = Handicap modified by the Handicap Committee
          N = Nine-hole Handicap Index
          
            
              
            NL = Local nine-hole handicap
          R = Handicap automatically reduced for exceptional tournament performance
          SL = Short Course Handicap
          WD = Handicap withdrawn by the Handicap Committee
          
            Inactive Season
          An "inactive season" is the period during which scores made in an area are not accepted for handicap purposes determined by the authorized golf association having jurisdiction in a given area.
          
            Index (See Handicap Index.)
          
            Local Handicap 
          A "local handicap" is either a handicap that is above the maximum Handicap Index limit (Section 3-4), a handicap that is revised more frequently than allowed (Section 8-3) or a handicap based on a player's temporary disability. A local handicap is not a Handicap Index, and it must be identified by the letter "L" to indicate that it is for local use only. A local handicap is expressed as a number taken to one decimal place and is used to convert to a Course Handicap (e.g., 41.5L). (See handicap type, trend handicap, and Section 3-3.)
          
            Most Likely Score 
          A "most likely score" is the score a player must post for handicap purposes if a hole is started but not completed or if the player is conceded a stroke. The most likely score consists of the number of strokes already taken plus, in the player's best judgment, the number of strokes the player would take to complete the hole from that position more than half the time. This number may not exceed the player's Equitable Stroke Control limit. (See Section 4-3.)
          
            Net Score
          A "net score" is a player's score after handicap strokes have been subtracted from the player's gross score. A plus handicap player adds handicap strokes to the player's gross score to yield a net score.
          
            Override
          An "override" is a Handicap Committee's action to cancel a tournament score reduction (Section 10-3). An override is not to be used as a preventive measure to block an anticipated Section 10-3 reduction.
          
            Par
          
            
              "Par"
             is the score that an expert player would be expected to make for a given hole. Par means expert play under ordinary weather conditions, allowing two strokes on the putting green. Par is not a significant factor in either the USGA Handicap System or USGA Course Rating System. (See Section 16.)
          
            Peer Review
          
            
              "Peer review"
             is the ability of golfers to gain an understanding of a player's potential ability and to form a reasonable basis for supporting or disputing a score that has been posted.
          There are two essential elements of peer review:
          1. Members of a golf club must have a reasonable and regular opportunity to play together (see Decision 2/8).
          2. Access must be provided to scoring records, as well as to a Handicap Index list, for inspection by others, including, but not limited to, fellow club members. There are two forms of scoring record display:
          General - A General scoring record must provide the six most recent revisions of the player's Handicap Index, along with scores, score types, ratings, differentials and dates (month and year only) relating to the most recent handicap revision. This must be made available to those involved in peer review.
          Complete - A Complete scoring record must provide the six most recent revisions of the player's Handicap Index, along with scores*, score types, ratings, differentials and dates (month, day and year) relating to the most recent handicap revision. This must be made available to fellow club members, the club Handicap Committee and competition officials of any competition in which the player is going to participate.
          *The course name for each score should appear in any "Complete" scoring record display and must be included for a Type 3 club.
          
            Penalty Score
          A "penalty score" is a score posted by the Handicap Committee for a player who does not return a score or otherwise does not observe the spirit of the USGA Handicap System. (See Section 8-4b and 8-4c(iv) .)
          
            Plus Handicap (See Course Handicap.)
          
            Preferred Lies (Winter Rules)
          
            
              "Preferred Lies"
             (winter rules) is a local rule that may be adopted by the Committee in charge of the competition or the Committee in charge of the course, in the event of adverse conditions that are so general throughout a course that improving the lie of the ball in a specified way would promote fair play or help protect the course. (See Section 7 and "The Rules of Golf," Appendix I.)
          
            Score Type
          A "score type" indicates specific aspects of a score within a player's scoring record and should be designated in the following manner:
          A = Away 
          AI = Away Internet 
          C = Combined Nines 
          I = Internet
          P = Penalty 
          T = Tournament 
          TI = Tournament Internet
          The designated letter(s) must immediately follow the adjusted gross score if the score type is either a tournament score or an Internet-posted score.
          
            Scoring Record
          A "scoring record" is a file of up to twenty of the most recent scores posted by a player, plus any eligible tournament scores, along with appropriate USGA Course Rating, Slope Rating, course*, and date of each score.
          *Type 1 and Type 2 golf club recommendation. Type 3 golf club requirement.
          
            Scratch Golfer
          
            A "
            
              scratch golfer"
            
             is a player who can play to a 
            
              Course Handicap
            
             of zero on any and all rated golf courses. A male 
            
              scratch golfer
            
            , for rating purposes, can hit tee shots an average of 250 yards and can reach a 470-yard hole in two shots at sea level. A female 
            
              scratch golfer
            
            , for rating purposes, can hit tee shots an average of 210 yards and can reach a 400-yard hole in two shots at sea level. 
          
          
            Slope Rating
          
            A "
            
              Slope Rating"
            
             is the USGA's mark that indicates the measurement of the relative difficulty of a course for players who are not 
            
              scratch golfers
            
             compared to the 
            
              USGA 
            
            
            
              Course Rating
            
             (e.g.
            
              ,
            
             compared to the difficulty of a course for 
            
              scratch golfers
            
            ). A 
            
              Slope Rating
            
             is computed from the difference between the 
            
              Bogey Rating
            
             and the 
            
              USGA Course Rating
            
            . The lowest 
            
              Slope Rating
            
             is 55 and the highest is 155. A golf course of standard playing difficulty has a 
            
              Slope Rating
            
             of 113.
          
          
            Stipulated Round
          A "stipulated round" consists of playing the holes of the course in their correct sequence unless otherwise authorized by the Committee in charge of the competition. The number of holes in a stipulated round is 18 unless a smaller number is authorized by the Committee. The Committee may, for the purpose of settling a tie, extend the stipulated round to as many holes as are required for a match to be won. (See "The Rules of Golf," Definitions and Rule 2-3.)
          
            Stroke Hole (See Handicap-Stroke Hole.)
          
            Tournament Score
          A "tournament score" is a score made in a competition organized and conducted by the Committee in charge of the competition. The competition must identify a winner(s) based on a stipulated round(s), and must be played under the principles of the Rules of Golf.
          Using the above definition as a guideline, the Committee (preferably the Handicap Committee in consultation with the Committee in charge of the competition) must determine in advance if these conditions are met and announce in advance whether the score must be identified by the letter "T" when posted.
          Routine events, such as regular play days, normally are not to be designated as T-scores because they are not significant in the traditions, schedules, formats, and membership of the club. (See eligible tournament score.)
          Examples of inter-club competition scores that may be posted as tournament scores when they meet the above conditions are: competitions restricted by age, member-guest competitions, team matches, qualifying rounds for city, state, and national competitions, and competitions conducted by golf associations.
          Examples of intra-club competition scores that may be posted as tournament scores when they meet the above conditions are low gross-low net competitions, four-ball match or stroke-play competitions, Stableford competitions, and club championships which are stroke or match play, scratch, or with handicap.
          
            Trend Handicap
          A "trend handicap" is an estimate of a handicap. It may include un-reviewed scores posted since the previous revision. The trend is not a Handicap Index, (See local handicap). A Trend Handicap must be identified by the letter "L" to indicate it is a local handicap.
          
            USGA Course Rating 
          A "USGA Course Rating" is the USGA's mark that indicates the evaluation of the playing difficulty of a course for a scratch golfer under normal course and weather conditions. It is expressed as strokes taken to one decimal place, and is based on yardage and other obstacles to the extent that they affect the scoring ability of a scratch golfer. (See Section 13.)
          
            USGA Handicap Index (See Handicap Index)
          
            USGA Handicap System
          The "USGA Handicap System" is the USGA's mark that denotes the USGA's method of evaluating golf skills so that players of differing abilities can compete on an equitable basis.

          Section 3 THE PLAYER
          Definitions
          Within each section, all defined terms are in italics and are listed alphabetically in Section 2 -  Definitions.
          A Handicap Index is the result of a mathematical calculation based on scores returned. A Handicap Index is converted to a Course Handicap for competition from a particular set of tees.
          
            3-1. Obtaining a Handicap Index
          In order to obtain a Handicap Index, a player must join a golf club and post adjusted gross scores. These scores are subject to peer review. After at least five scores have been posted, the club will be eligible to issue a Handicap Index to the player in accordance with the USGA Handicap System.
          
            3-2. Using a Handicap Index
          A Handicap Index, issued by a golf club, is a number that represents the potential ability of a player on a course with a Slope Rating of 113. The Handicap Index is updated and reissued at established revision dates set by authorized golf associations. A player is responsible for knowing the Handicap Index issued to the player at the most recent revision. A player must convert a Handicap Index to a Course Handicap. For example, a Handicap Index of 16.2 would convert to a Course Handicap of 20 at a course with a Slope Rating of 140, using the sample Course Handicap Table in this section. (See Decisions 3-2/1, 3-2/2.)
          
            3-3. Course Handicap
          A Course Handicap is the number of handicap strokes a player receives from a particular set of tees at the course being played. 
          To convert a Handicap Index to a Course Handicap, a player takes the Handicap Index to a Course Handicap Table to find the corresponding Course Handicap. Each set of rated tees will have a different Course Handicap Table for men and women based on its Slope Rating. It is the player's responsibility to determine the correct Course Handicap, and to know the holes at which handicap strokes are to be given or received. (See sample Course Handicap Table, Section 3-6, and "The Rules of Golf," Rule 6-2).
          A player's Course Handicap is determined by multiplying a Handicap Index by the Slope Rating of the course played and then dividing by 113. (See Section 10-4.) The resulting figure is rounded off to the nearest whole number (.5 or more is rounded upward).
          A player who has a net score that is equal to the USGA Course Rating for the tees played "has played to that player's handicap." In general, this will occur about once every four or five rounds.
          A Course Handicap Table is designed to determine a Course Handicap. It is for use only with the USGA Handicap System by an authorized golf association and a golf club that has a valid USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating.

            3-4. Maximum Handicap Index
          The maximum Handicap Index is 36.4 for men and 40.4 for women. (See Section 10-5d.)
          
            
              
                Note:
              
             A maximum Handicap Index will convert to a Course Handicap that exceeds these numbers on golf courses with a Slope Rating greater than 113.
          
            
              Example
            : A player with a Handicap Index of 36.4 will have a Course Handicap of 43 on a course with a Slope Rating of 133.
          A player may have a local handicap above these limits, but it must be identified as a local handicap by the letter "L" following the number on a handicap card or report (e.g., 41.5L). When such local handicaps are used for inter-club play, the USGA recommends that they be reduced to the maximum Handicap Index as specified.
          
            3-5. Players Competing from Different Tees or Men and Women from Same Tees
          
             a. Different Tees: Men vs. Men; Women vs. Women; Women vs. Men
          Different tees usually have different Ratings. Because a USGA Course Rating reflects the probable score of a scratch golfer, the higher-rated course is more difficult, and the player playing from the set of tees with the higher USGA Course Rating receives additional stroke(s) equal to the difference between each USGA Course Rating, with .5 or greater rounded upward. The additional stroke(s) are added to the Course Handicap of the player playing from the higher-rated set of tees. (See Decision 3-5/1.)
          
            
              Example 1
            : If men playing from the middle tees where the men's USGA Course Rating is 70.3 compete against men playing from the back tees where the men's USGA Course Rating is 72.6, the men playing from the back tees will add two strokes (72.6 - 70.3 = 2.3 rounded to 2 ) to their Course Handicap.
          
            
              Example 2:
             If women playing from the forward tees from which the women's USGA Course Rating is 73.4 compete against men playing from the middle tees from which the men's USGA Course Rating is 70.9, the women will add three strokes (73.4 - 70.9 = 2.5 rounded to 3) to their Course Handicap.
          
             b. Same Tees: Men vs. Women 
          Men and women playing from the same set of tees will have different ratings. Because the women's USGA Course Rating usually will be higher, women receive additional stroke(s) equal to the difference between ratings, with .5 or greater rounded upward.
          
            
              Example
            : If women playing from the middle tees from which the women's USGA Course Rating is 77.3 compete against men playing from the middle tees from which the men's USGA Course Rating is 70.9, the women will add six strokes (77.3 - 70.9 = 6.4 rounded to 6) to their Course Handicap.
          
            The adjustment must be added to the higher-rated tee players' 
            
              Course Handicap
            
             even if it causes a 
            
              Course Handicap
            
             to exceed the maximum possible for the 
            
              Slope Rating
            
             of the set of tees being played. Alternatively, it is permissible to subtract the extra handicap strokes from the Course Handicap of the player playing from the tees with the lower USGA Course Rating.
          
          How to Properly Apply Section 3-5:
          
            Step 1: Calculate Course Handicap from tees played per Section 3-3. 
          Look up each player's Course Handicap on the appropriate gender-based Course Handicap Table for the tees played or use the Course Handicap formula:
          
            
              Handicap Index
             x Slope Rating of tees played, and then divided by 113. 
          
            
              Example:
             A woman with a Handicap Index of 26.5 who is playing from tees with a Slope Rating of 120 has a Course Handicap of 28. (See Section 3-3 to compute a Course Handicap.)
          A man with a Handicap Index of 26.5 who is playing from tees with a Slope Rating of 115 has a Course Handicap of 27. (See Section 3-3 to compute a Course Handicap.)
          
            Step 2: Apply any handicap allowance per Section 9-4 (if applicable). 
          
            
              Example:
             Suppose the Committee in charge of a four-ball stroke play competition determines that men compete at 90 percent and women at 95 percent of Course Handicap.
          The Course Handicap of 27 for the man in step 1 would be reduced to 24 handicap strokes (27 x .90 = 24.3, with the difference of .4 or less rounded downward to 24 strokes).
          The Course Handicap of 28 for the woman in step 1 would be reduced to 27 handicap strokes (28 x .95 = 26.6, with the difference of .5 or greater rounded upward to 27 strokes). 
          
            Step 3: Calculate the difference in USGA Course Rating from tees played, with any difference of .5 or greater rounded upward.
          
            
              Example:
             Suppose the man in step 2 is playing from the middle tees from which the USGA Course Rating is 73.7 and the woman is playing from the front tees from which the USGA Course Rating is 69.8. 
          
            
              USGA Course Rating
             73.7  - USGA Course Rating 69.8 = 3.9, with the difference of .5 or greater rounded upward to 4 strokes.
          Add the extra handicap strokes from step 3 to the Course Handicap of the player playing from the tees with the higher USGA Course Rating. Alternatively, it is permissible to subtract the extra handicap strokes from the Course Handicap of the player playing from the tees with the lower USGA Course Rating. (See Decision 3-5/1.)
          
            
              Example:
             A man playing the tees with the higher USGA Course Rating (73.7), adds 4 strokes to his Course Handicap and competes off 28 strokes (24 + 4 = 28 strokes), while the woman in steps 2 and 3 competes off 27 strokes. 
          Alternatively, the woman could be reduced to a Course Handicap of 23 strokes (27  -  4 = 23 strokes), while the man in steps 2 and 3 competes off 24 strokes.
          
            
              
                Note:
              
             Strokes given or received under the procedures in steps 2 and 3 above are to be disregarded when applying ESC for handicap purposes. (See Section 4-3, Examples 2 and 3.) Example: After a Section 3-5 adjustment, a player has added three strokes to a Course Handicap of 25. The Course Handicap when applying Equitable Stroke Control is 25. The correct handicap for competition is 28. (See Section 3-6.)
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
           
          See Appendix D for a sample letter explaining Sections 3-5 and 9-3c.
          
            3-6. Applying Handicaps Correctly in Competitions
          
            Rule 6-2 of "The Rules of Golf" requires players to apply handicaps correctly in competition. The correct handicap for competition should mean the 
            
              Course Handicap
            
             adjusted for any strokes given or received as a result of 
            
              handicap allowance
            
            , condition of competition, players competing from different tees, 
        or men and women from the same tees. (See Sections 9-4 and 3-5.)
          
          
             a. Match Play
          Before starting a match in a handicap competition, each player should determine from one another the player's respective Course Handicap. If a player begins a match having declared a Course Handicap higher than that to which the player is entitled and this affects the number of strokes given or received, the player is disqualified; otherwise, the player must play off the declared Course Handicap.
          
             b. Stroke Play
          In any round of a handicap competition, the player must ensure that the player's Course Handicap is recorded on the score card before it is returned to the Committee. If no Course Handicap is recorded on the score card before it is returned (Rule 6-6b), or if the recorded Course Handicap is higher than that to which the player is entitled and this affects the number of strokes received, the player is disqualified; otherwise, the score stands.
          
            
              Note
            
            : It is the player's responsibility to know the holes at which handicap strokes are to be given or received.

      <title>Adjusting Hole Scores</title>
      <body>
          
            Section 4 ADJUSTING HOLE SCORES
          
          Definitions
          Within each section, all defined terms are in italics and are listed alphabetically in Section 2 - Definitions.
          The game of golf is based on the premise that a player will play as well as the player can play. Under the USGA Handicap System, each player is required to record a hole score for a hole not finished, not played, or not played under "The Rules of Golf," and to reduce any hole score when it is higher than the maximum number allowed under Equitable Stroke Control.
          
            
              
            4-1. Unfinished Holes and Conceded Strokes
          A player who starts, but does not complete a hole or is conceded a stroke must record for handicap purposes the most likely score. The most likely score may not exceed the player's Equitable Stroke Control limit, defined in Section 4-3. This most likely score should be preceded by an "X." (See Decision 4-1/1.) 
          There is no limit to the number of unfinished holes a player may have in a round, provided that failure to finish is not for the purpose of handicap manipulation.
          
            
              Example 1:
             A and B are partners in a four-ball stroke play competition. On a hole on which neither player receives a handicap stroke, A lies two, 18 feet from the hole. B lies two, 25 feet from the hole. B holes a putt for a 3. A picks up on the hole, because A cannot better B's score. A records X-4 on the scorecard because 4 is A's most likely score.
          
            
              Example 2:
             A and B are playing a match. On a hole on which neither player receives a handicap stroke, A has holed out in 4; B has a 30-foot putt for a 5. B has lost the hole, and picks up. B records X-6 on the scorecard because 6 is B's most likely score.
          
            
              Example 3:
             A and B are playing a match. On a hole on which neither player receives a handicap stroke, A is one foot from the hole, lying 4. B is 10 feet from the hole, lying 3. B putts and misses. They both concede a half. Both players record X-5 because that is their most likely score.
          
            
              
            4-2. Holes Not Played or Not Played Under The Principles of The Rules of Golf
          If a player does not play a hole or plays it other than under the principles of the Rules of Golf (except for preferred lies), the score recorded for that hole for handicap purposes must be par plus any handicap strokes the player is entitled to receive on that hole. This hole score, when recorded, should be preceded by an "X."
          Example: A player with a Course Handicap of 10 receives a handicap stroke on the first 10 allocated handicap-stroke holes. If the player does not play the sixth allocated handicap-stroke hole, which is a par 4, because of construction on the green, the player must record a score of par plus one for handicap purposes, or X-5. (See Decision 4-2/1 and Section 5-2b.)
          
            
              
            4-3. Equitable Stroke Control
          All scores for handicap purposes, including tournament scores, are subject to the application of Equitable Stroke Control (ESC). This mandatory procedure reduces high hole scores for handicap purposes in order to make handicaps more representative of a player's potential ability.
          A handicap determined from scores to which ESC has not been applied may not be termed a Handicap Index. 
          
            
              ESC
             is used when a player's actual or most likely score exceeds a maximum number, based on the table below, for the player's Course Handicap from the tees played. (For nine-hole Equitable Stroke Control table, See Section 10-5c.)
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
          
          
            
              Example:
             A player with a Course Handicap of 6 has a maximum number of par plus two strokes (double bogey) for any hole. A player with a Course Handicap of 13 has a maximum number of 7 for any hole regardless of par. A player with a Course Handicap of 42 has a maximum number of 10 for any hole.
          A player without an established Handicap Index must use the maximum Handicap Index of 36.4 for men, or 40.4 for women, converted to a Course Handicap, to determine a maximum ESC number.
          There is no limit to the number of individual hole scores on which an Equitable Stroke Control reduction may be made. 
          
            
              Example:
             The round of a player with a Course Handicap of 23 includes individual hole scores of 9, 10, and 11. ESC reduces each hole score to the applicable maximum of 8. The player's adjusted gross score enters the scoring record for handicap purposes 6 strokes less than had ESC not been applied (9-8) + (10-8) + (11-8) = 6. 
          In consulting the Equitable Stroke Control table, a player uses the Course Handicap derived from that player's actual Handicap Index, disregarding any strokes added or subtracted because of a condition of competition, a handicap allowance, players competing from different tees, or men and women from the same tees. (See Sections 3-5, 9-3c, and 9-4.)
          
            
              Example 1:
             A player with a Handicap Index of 35.4 and a Course Handicap of 39 might enter a competition in which the conditions of the competition establish a maximum Handicap Index limit of 25.4, which would yield a Course Handicap of 28. When applying ESC, that player uses the Course Handicap of 39.
          
            
              Example 2:
             A player with a Course Handicap of 30 might play in a four-ball stroke play competition in which the handicap allowance is 90 percent, or 27 strokes. When applying ESC, that player uses the Course Handicap of 30.
          
            
              Example 3:
             A player with a Handicap Index of 25.4 and a Course Handicap of 28 might enter a competition in which players are competing from different tees. The difference between the higher-rated set of tees (a USGA Course Rating of 73.0) and the lower-rated set of tees (a USGA Course Rating of 71.2) is 2 strokes (73.0-71.2=1.8 rounded to 2). From the course with the USGA Course Rating of 73.0, the player would receive two additional strokes, which would give the player a Course Handicap of 30 (see Decision 3-5/1 for the only exception). However, when applying ESC, the player uses a Course Handicap of 28.
          
            
              Example 4: A player with a Handicap Index of 25.4 and a Course Handicap of 28 is in a tournament where the player shot a score of 92 without applying ESC. The player turns in the score of 92 for the tournament, but must include any ESC adjustments when posting for handicap purposes.
          Under no circumstances must the procedures of this section be used by a player to manipulate a Handicap Index. The Handicap Index of a player who uses this section for such a purpose must be adjusted or withdrawn by the Handicap Committee under Section 8-4.

      <body>
          Section 5 SCORES
          Definitions
          Within each section, all defined terms are in italics and are listed alphabetically in Section 2 - Definitions.
          
            
              
            5-1. Acceptability of Scores
          Fair handicapping depends upon full and accurate information regarding a player's potential scoring ability as reflected by a complete scoring record. Every player must be responsible for returning all acceptable scores, as defined in this section. For handicap purposes, all Section 4 adjustments, including Equitable Stroke Control, must be applied to all scores including tournament scores.
          
             a. Scores To Post
          To post a 9-hole score, the player must play 7 to 12 holes, and at least 7 holes must be played in accordance with the principle of the Rules of Golf.  To post an 18-hole score, the player must play at least 13 holes in accordance with the principles of the Rules of Golf. (See Decisions 5-1a/3 through 5-1a/5.)
          
             b. Scores on All Courses
          
            
              Adjusted gross scores
             from all courses with a USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating made during an active season, both at home and away, must be posted by the player along with the appropriate USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating. (See Decision 5-1b/1.)
          
             c. Scores in All Forms of Competition
          Scores in both match play and stroke play must be posted for handicap purposes. This includes scores made in match play, in multi-ball, or in team competitions in which players have not completed one or more holes or in which players are requested to pick up when out of contention on a hole. (See Decision 5-1c/1 and Section 4.)
          
             d. Disqualification
          A player who is disqualified from a competition, but has an acceptable score, must record an adjusted gross score for handicap purposes. For example, a player who is disqualified from a competition for failure to sign a scorecard has an acceptable score for handicap purposes.
          
             e. Unacceptable Scores
          Scores made under the following conditions are not acceptable for handicap purposes and must not be entered in the player's scoring record:
          (i) When fewer than seven holes are played; 
          (ii) When made on a golf course in an area in which an inactive season established by the authorized golf association is in effect;
          (iii) When the length of the course is less than 3,000 yards for 18 holes (or less than 1,500 yards for 9 holes); 
          (iv) When, as a condition of the competition, the maximum number of clubs allowed is less than 14, or types of clubs are limited as, for example, in a competition that allows only iron clubs;
          (v) When scores are made on a course with no USGA Course Rating or Slope Rating;
          (vi) When a player uses non-conforming clubs, non-conforming balls, or tees;
          (vii) With respect to Rule 14-3 (Rules of Golf), when an artificial device or piece of unusual equipment is used during the execution of a stroke or when equipment is used in an unusual manner during the execution of a stroke. (See Decision 5-1e/3.) 
          
            
              
            5-2. Posting Scores
          
             a. General
          Posting scores in person immediately following the round at the course where the round is played is the preferred way to expose scores to peer review. This method of posting must be used whenever possible. The place for returning scores from all courses should be convenient to make it as easy as possible for players to record every round played. The form of reporting is the responsibility of the golf club or the authorized golf association, and will depend upon the procedure adopted by the Handicap Committee. The posted scores for the day must be immediately available to all members for peer review. (See Decision 5-2a/1.)
          For handicap purposes, the following information must be returned in person immediately following the round at the course where the round was played or, if that is not possible, as soon as practical prior to the next revision so that a scoring record is up-to-date (See Decision 5-2a/2): 
          (i) Player's name or identification number; (ii) Date;(iii) Course Name*;(iv) USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating of the course played; (v) Adjusted gross score; (vi) Score type for tournament scores or scores posted via the Internet. (See score type.)
          
            *Type 1 and Type 2 golf club recommendation. Type 3 golf club requirement.
          The Handicap Committee may adopt a policy to accept scores returned by e-mail, facsimile, Internet, or surface mail. Scores may not be returned verbally by the telephone.
          Scores returned to the club by e-mail, facsimile, Internet, or surface mail must be exposed to the same peer review as scores posted in person at the club. If a club adopts a policy to accept scores via e-mail, facsimile, Internet, or surface mail, the Handicap Committee must designate an official at the club who is authorized to receive these scores. If a golf club adopts a policy to accept scores posted via the Internet, the club must also provide the ability to review all scores of all members via the Internet.
          Total scores may be returned and need not be recorded hole-by-hole. The Handicap Committee may require the returning or attesting of scorecards periodically in order to assist in its responsibilities, but this requirement must not be used to affect the acceptability of a score. A score is acceptable for handicap posting purposes regardless of whether a scorecard accompanies it. (See Decisions 5-2a/3 and 5-2a/4.)
          
             b. Posting a Score When a Complete Round is not Played
          If 13 or more holes are played, the player must post an 18-hole score. If 7 to 12 holes are played, the player must post a nine-hole score. In either case, scores for unplayed holes must be recorded as par plus any handicap strokes that the player is entitled to receive on the unplayed holes. (See Section 4-2 and 5-1a .)
          
            
              Example:
             A player with a Course Handicap of 30 stops playing after 16 holes because of darkness. Hole 17 is a par 3 and is the number 18 handicap-stroke hole. The player will record 3 (par) plus 1 handicap stroke for an X-4 on hole 17. Hole 18 is a par 4 and is the number 12 handicap-stroke hole. The player will record 4 (par) plus 2 handicap strokes for an X-6 on hole 18.
          
             c. Posting Nine-Hole Scores
          To be acceptable for handicap purposes, nine-hole scores must meet the following conditions:
          (i) The course must have a nine-hole USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating; (ii) At least seven holes must be played. 
          There is no restriction on the number of nine-hole scores posted to a player's scoring record. Even if a player plays a majority of nine-hole rounds, that player can still utilize a Handicap Index (See Section 10-2) rather than a Handicap Index (N). (See Section 10-5 for computation of a Handicap Index (N).) (See Decision 5-2c/1.)
          
             d. Treatment of Nine-Hole Scores
          Once posted, a nine-hole score will be treated as follows:
          (i) Nine-hole scores must not be designated as T-Scores; (ii) When two nine-hole scores are combined, the USGA Course Rating is the sum of each nine-hole USGA Course Rating and the Slope Rating is the average of the Slope Rating of the two nines (if the average is .5, it is rounded upward to the next whole number);(iii) Two nine-hole scores combined to create an 18-hole score should be designated with the letter C (e.g., 85C). If either of the two nine-hole scores was posted via Internet (See Section 5-2a(vi)), the score should be designated CI; (iv) Nine-hole scores are combined in the order that they are received into the player's scoring record from any club or from any combination of nines, regardless of score type. For example, a front nine middle tee score could combine with a front nine back tee score made from any course.An 18-hole score created by the combination of two nine-hole scores will display the date and course name (if applicable) of the latest nine hole score (e.g., April 29 and May 4 = May 4).A nine-hole score will be retained for combination with another nine-hole score until it is older than the twentieth oldest eighteen-hole score in the scoring record. Nine-hole scores will be combined in the order they are received in the player's record, and not necessarily by date.
          
             e. Posting a Tournament Score
          A tournament score is a score made in a competition organized and conducted by a Committee in charge of the competition. The competition must identify a winner(s) based on a stipulated round(s), and must be played under the principles of the Rules of Golf.
          The Committee (preferably the Handicap Committee, in consultation with the Committee in charge of the competition) must determine in advance if these conditions are met, and announce in advance whether the score must be identified by the letter "T" when posted. Routine events such as regular play days normally are not to be designated as T-scores because they are not significant in the traditions, schedules, formats, and membership of the club.
          
             f. Committee Posting a Score For a Player
          If a player fails to post a score, the Handicap Committee may post the score without the player's authorization. (See Section 8-4b.) In a competition, the Committee in charge of the competition may post the scores of all competitors. The Committee must notify the players that it will post the scores in order to prevent scores from being posted by both the players and the Committee.
          
             g. Posting a Score from an Unrated Set of Tees on a Rated Course
          
            
              Authorized golf associations
             issue a USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating for the most commonly played sets of tees. If a USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating from a selected set of tees are not available for the appropriate gender, the player may apply the following procedure on a temporary basis:
          • Locate the nearest set of rated tees for the appropriate gender; 
          • Determine the yardage difference between the set of tees being played and the rated set of tees; 
          • Using the following table, find the range that includes the yardage difference; 
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
          
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
           
          Add the resulting table values if the unrated tees are longer than the rated tees, or subtract the resulting values if the unrated tees are shorter than the rated tees. 
          This method may also be used if a player plays a combination of tees. The player first determines the total yardage played then applies the above procedure.
          If the Committee in charge of a competition has used a combination of tees for a competition course, this procedure may be used. This procedure is not a substitute for a formal USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating.
          For a nine-hole adjustment, the proper procedure is to use the actual yardage difference for the adjustment to the USGA Course Rating, and double the yardage difference to find the appropriate Slope Rating adjustment.
          
            
              Example 1: A woman plays from the middle tees, which are not rated for women. The women's USGA Course Rating from the forward tees is 71.6, with a Slope Rating of 119. The middle tees are 396 yards longer than the forward tees. She enters the 387 to 404 yard range, which corresponds to adding 2.2 to the USGA Course Rating and 5 to the Slope Rating of the forward tees. She will post her score with a USGA Course Rating of 73.8 (71.6 + 2.2) and a Slope Rating of 124 (119 + 5).
          
            
              Example 2: A man plays nine holes from the forward tees, which are not rated for men. The men's nine-hole USGA Course Rating from the middle tees is 34.8, with a Slope Rating of 117. The forward tees are 195 yards shorter than the middle tees. He enters the 187 to 208 yard range to subtract 0.9 from the USGA Course Rating and the 385 to 406 yard range (195 x 2 = 390) to subtract four from the Slope Rating of the middle tees. He will post his score with a USGA Course Rating of 33.9 (34.8 - 0.9) and a Slope Rating of 113 (117 - 4).
          
            
              
                Note 1
              : If a player plays a course which does not have the necessary men's or women's USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating, the player should notify the authorized golf association that has jurisdiction in that area.
          
            
              
                Note 2
              : If the yardage difference is more than 1,250 yards for women or 802 yards for men, the player finds one-half of the yardage difference on the table, doubles the corresponding numbers, and applies the procedure above. For example, if a man finds a yardage difference of 1,400 yards, he doubles the values for 700 yards from the table, and adds 6.4 (3.2 x 2) to the USGA Course Rating and 16 (8 x 2) to the Slope Rating.

      <title>Scoring Records</title>
      <body>
          Section 6 SCORING RECORDS
          Definitions
          Within each section, all defined terms are in italics and are listed alphabetically in Section 2 - Definitions.
          
            
              
            6-1. Continuous Records
          Scores made in a new playing season (or calendar year) must be added to those of the preceding playing seasons (or calendar years) to make up a scoring record. Scoring records must be maintained continuously from year to year. (See Decision 6-1/1.)
          
            
              
            6-2. Inactive Season
          The authorized golf association having jurisdiction in an area is responsible for declaring the duration of any inactive season. A golf club located within the area covered by an authorized golf association must observe any inactive season established by the golf association, even if the club is not a member of the association. (See Decision 6-2/1.)
          Scores made at any golf course observing an inactive season are not acceptable for handicap purposes. Scores made at a golf course in an area observing an active season must be posted for handicap purposes, even if the golf club from which the player receives a Handicap Index is observing an inactive season. The club's Handicap Committee must make it possible for a player to post these away scores prior to the next Handicap Index revision. 
          
            
              Example:
             If a player belonging to a golf club in Michigan plays golf in Florida during January, any scores made in Florida are acceptable and must be returned to the player's Michigan golf club. If the player is also a member of a golf club in Florida, scores must be posted to the player's Florida club.
          
            
              
            6-3. Handicap Lists and Scoring Records
          The accessibility of scoring records is an important component of peer review. Accordingly, the club must display a Handicap Index member listing as well as current scoring records of all players as of the most recent revision date. This must be in a prominent location for inspection by fellow members and others. (See Decisions 6-3/1 and 6-3/2.)
          Handicap reports serve as an adequate working record for each player. The working record must, at a minimum, include the last 20 scores (fewer if the scoring record has fewer than 20 scores), dates of play, a USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating, and the course name* for each score, as well as a record of the Handicap Index issued at the most recent revision. If a computer with handicap information is directly accessible to members, scoring records may be displayed in this manner. However, for the purpose of peer review, the club should print out a Handicap Index list, the current scoring record, as well as a report of Internet-posted scores (if allowed), as of the most recent revision date. 
          *Type 1 and 2 golf club recommendation. Type 3 golf club requirement. 
          
            
              
            6-4. Handicap Cards
          Every player may be issued a handicap card or label that can be affixed to a card on which the player's Handicap Index is recorded. Handicaps on cards issued by an authorized golf association or a golf club that follows the USGA Handicap System must be identified as a Handicap Index. The name of the golf club or authorized golf association issuing the Handicap Index must be displayed on such cards and labels. If the name of the computation service appears on the card, it must be no more than 1/4 inch in height and must be smaller than the identification of the issuing authority.







  6-5. Player Belonging to More Than One Golf ClubA player who belongs to more than one golf club must do either of the following:(a) Register as a multi-member with the authorized golf association or computation service, if such service is provided, so that all scores at every club will enter into the player's scoring record for computation; or (b) Return all scores to all clubs in person, or, if the club allows, by e-mail, fax, Internet, or surface mail (See Section 5-2), together with the USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating, and date. If a player maintains a Handicap Index at more than one club, and the clubs do not use a networked computation service, all acceptable scores must be posted at all clubs. (See Decision 6-5/1.) This will result in the same Handicap Index at all clubs unless there are administrative problems such as transmission problems or mailing delays. Failure to post all acceptable scores at all clubs produces a Handicap Index that is not based on the player's best 10 differentials of the last 20 scores and consequently may not be termed a Handicap Index. If a player has a different Handicap Index at different clubs, despite posting all scores at all clubs, the Committee in charge of the competition may require the player to use the lowest Handicap Index when competing with players from more than one club. (See Decision 6-5/3.)6-6. Player Changing Golf ClubsWhen changing golf clubs, a player should give the new club a record of the last 20 scores in chronological order plus any eligible tournament scores recorded with the appropriate USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating. This information will become part of the player's scoring record at the new club and in general will not result in a Handicap Index until after the next handicap revision. The player must also have at least five scores in the scoring record. If the player's scoring record is unavailable, the player has no Handicap Index until five scores have been posted and a handicap revision passes. The Handicap Committee can issue a modified Handicap Index in the interim period if at least five scores exist in the scoring record. (See Section 3-1 and 8-2h .) 6-7. Records of Resigned MembersThe scoring record of a member who resigns should be preserved by the previous golf club or authorized golf association for at least one year in the event a new golf club may need it.The Handicap Index of a resigned member remains valid only until the next revision date at the golf club that issued the Handicap Index. When the player joins a new golf club, a new Handicap Index is issued at the first revision date observed by that club, based on the scoring record from the prior club and any scores recorded in the interim. During this period the Handicap Committee may issue a Handicap Index(M) based on any available scores. In either situation, five scores must exist in the scoring record for a Handicap Index or Handicap Index (M) to be issued. (See Section 8-2i.)</body>

      <body>
          Section 7 PREFERRED LIES (WINTER RULES) AND ADVERSE COURSE CONDITIONS
          Definitions
          Within each section, all defined terms are in italics and are listed alphabetically in Section 2 - Definitions.
          
            
              
            7-1. Acceptability of Scores When Playing Preferred Lies
          Scores made when a Local Rule for preferred lies (winter rules) is in effect must be posted for handicap purposes unless the Committee (preferably the Handicap Committee in consultation with the Committee in charge of the course) determines that course conditions are so poor that such scores are not acceptable and should not be posted. Individual players playing the course do not independently decide whether scores are acceptable because of the conditions. If an individual decides to apply some form of this Local Rule, and the Committee has not invoked such a rule, the player's score is acceptable and must be posted for handicap purposes.
          If adverse conditions such as flooding, mud, heavy snow, etc. are widespread throughout the course, the Committee should consider suspending score posting until conditions improve. If the Committee decides to suspend score posting due to poor course conditions, it should notify all players playing the course that scores should not be posted. 
          If the Committee decides to adopt a Local Rule for preferred lies, it should publish Specimen Local Rule 4c in "The Rules of Golf," Rule 33-8a and in Appendix I of "The Rule of Golf." However, Specimen Local Rule 4c may not be printed or referred to on a score card as it is of limited duration. The Local Rule should be withdrawn as soon as the conditions warrant. 
          ("The Rules of Golf," Appendix I, Part B, 4c.)
          Preferred Lies (Winter Rules) and Adverse Course Conditions
          Occasional local abnormal conditions that might interfere with fair play and are not widespread may be defined as ground under repair ("The Rules of Golf," Rule 25).
          However, adverse conditions, such as heavy snows, spring thaws, prolonged rains, or extreme heat can make fairways unsatisfactory and sometimes prevent use of heavy mowing equipment. When these conditions are so general throughout a course that the Committee believes preferred lies (winter rules) would promote fair play or help protect the course, the following Local Rule is recommended: 
          "A ball lying on a closely mown area through the green [or specify a more restricted area, e.g., at the 6th hole] may be lifted without penalty and cleaned. Before lifting the ball, the player must mark its position. Having lifted the ball, he must place it on a spot within [specify area, e.g., six inches, one club-length, etc.] of and not nearer the hole than where it originally lay, that is not in a hazard and not on a putting green.
          A player may place his ball only once, and it is in play when it has been placed (Rule 20-4). If the ball fails to come to rest on the spot on which it was placed, Rule 20-3d applies. If the ball when placed comes to rest on the spot on which it is placed and it subsequently moves, there is no penalty, and the ball must be played as it lies, unless the provisions of any other Rule apply.
          If the player fails to mark the position of the ball before lifting it or moves the ball in any other manner, such as rolling it with a club, the player incurs a penalty of one stroke.
          Note: "Closely mown area" means any area of the course, including paths through the rough, cut to fairway height or less.
          *PENALTY FOR BREACH OF LOCAL RULE:
          Match play - Loss of hole; Stroke play - Two strokes 
          *If a player incurs the general penalty for a breach of this Local Rule, no additional penalty under the Local Rule is applied."
          For example, as noted above, in stroke play, a player who incurs a two stroke penalty for incorrectly invoking the Local Rule when it was not declared in effect will not also receive a one-stroke penalty for failing to mark the position of the ball before lifting it.
          
            
              
            7-2. Pitfalls in Adopting Preferred Lies
          Before a Committee adopts the Local Rule permitting preferred lies (winter rules), the following facts should be considered:
          (a) Such a Local Rule conflicts with the fundamental principle of playing the ball as it lies; 
          (b) Preferred lies is sometimes adopted under the guise of protecting the course when, in fact, the practical effect is just the opposite - it permits moving the ball to the best turf, from which divots are then taken to injure the course further; 
          (c) Preferred lies tends generally to lower scores and a Handicap Index, thus penalizing players in competition with players whose scores are made without preferred lies; 
          (d) Extended use or indiscriminate use of preferred lies will place players at a disadvantage when competing at a course where the ball must be played as it lies. 
          
            
              
            7-3. Maintaining Normal Scoring Difficulty
          When the Local Rule for preferred lies is adopted, the Committee should ensure that the course's normal scoring difficulty is maintained as nearly as possible through adjustment of tee markers and related methods. (See Course Setup, Section 15.)

          Section 8 THE HANDICAP COMMITTEE
          Definitions
          Within each section, all defined terms are in italics and are listed alphabetically in Section 2 - Definitions.
          An essential element of the USGA Handicap System is the Handicap Committee. Each golf club or authorized golf association utilizing the USGA Handicap System must appoint a Handicap Committee to ensure the integrity of each Handicap Index it issues. This Committee must make certain that the members comply with the USGA Handicap System.
          
            
              
            8-1. Handicap Committee Chairperson
          The position of handicap chairperson requires a substantial amount of time and a basic knowledge of the USGA Handicap System. The more information the handicap chairperson gives the members, the more cooperation the chairperson is likely to receive. (See Decisions 8-1/1 and 8-1/1.5.)
          
            
              
            8-2. Duties and Responsibilities
          The Handicap Committee within the golf club is responsible for all aspects of the USGA Handicap System, including the computation of each member's Handicap Index. The Handicap Committee must verify that all acceptable scores are reported for handicap purposes, and that recorded scores are available for peer review. In addition, the Handicap Committee has the authority to make the determination if course conditions are so poor that score posting should be suspended. If score posting is suspended for an extended period, the golf club must obtain approval from its authorized golf association.
          
             a. Notice to Members
          It is advisable to send a notice to members before the season starts in order to outline the USGA Handicap System, to stress the importance of reporting all acceptable scores and to report the Handicap Committee's policies. The members may be advised of such matters as the following:
          (i) How and where scores are returned; 
          (ii) If handicap cards or labels are issued; 
          (iii) How each Handicap Index is verified at each revision; 
          (iv) The handicap revision schedule as determined by the authorized golf association; 
          (v) The duration of any inactive season established by the authorized golf association (See Section 6-2); 
          (vi) How away scores are posted prior to the start of the active season;
          (vii) Handicap Index adjustment responsibilities of the Handicap Committee (See Sections 8-4 and 10-3); 
          (viii) Penalties for players failing to return scores (See Section 8-4c(iv)); 
          (ix) Which rounds will be designated as tournament scores. (See Sections 8-2l and 10-3.) 
          
             b. Display each USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating of the Club
          The USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating from each set of tee markers should be printed on the club scorecard and posted in a prominent place at the club, preferably by means of a poster certified by the authorized golf association. The ratings should also be easily retrievable on the screen of any computer used for score posting.
          
             c. Displaying USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating of Area Courses
          A list of each USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating of area courses should be provided by the authorized golf association and posted at the place where scores are returned. If a computer is used for score posting, the list should be made easily available for viewing on the screen.
          
             d. Posting Course Handicap Tables
          The Course Handicap Table from each set of tee markers, as issued to a golf club by the authorized golf association, must be posted in a prominent place at the club, on or near the first tee of every course at the club, and in any other place considered beneficial for assisting with the process of converting a Handicap Index to a Course Handicap. The Handicap Committee is responsible for obtaining these tables from the issuing authorized golf association and assuring their display. Each table should show the tee's Slope Rating and USGA Course Rating, as well as the corresponding Course Handicap for a player's Handicap Index.Course Handicap Tables may be obtained from the authorized golf association that issued each rating. 
          
             e. Utilization of the Current USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating
          A club must accept and use the USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating that has been issued by an  authorized golf association.  If a club disagrees with its Ratings, it may request the  authorized golf association to review the Rating.
          A separate USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating must be made from each set of tee markers as practicable for each gender.
          
             f. Examining Results of Competitions
          The Handicap Committee should examine results of competitions. If net scores of any players appear exceptional, the Handicap Committee should take appropriate action under procedures in Sections 8-4 and 10-3. (See Appendix E.) The golf club or Handicap Committee should forward exceptional tournament scores of guests to the guest's golf club or golf association.
          
             g. Maintaining Players' Records
          The Handicap Committee must be responsible for maintaining players' records, including prominently displaying a Handicap Index list. Current scoring records of all players in the club from the most recent revision must be available to all members and others as noted in the definition of Peer Review. It is preferable for only one Committee member to be responsible for players' records and keeping the Handicap Index of each member up-to-date.
          If mathematical computations are made by a computer or computation service, the Handicap Committee still has the responsibility of reviewing the data entered into and received from the computer or computation service and applying all other procedures of the USGA Handicap System.
          
             h. New-Member Records
          The Handicap Committee has the responsibility for obtaining the scoring record (including USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating accompanying each score) of a new member. The Handicap Committee may seek the scoring record through the player's previous golf club, authorized golf association, or computation service, or by communicating directly with the player. If a record is unavailable, the new member must post five scores and have a handicap revision take place or have the Handicap Committee issue a modified Handicap Index in the interim period if at least five scores exist in the scoring record. (See Section 6-6 and Decision 6-1/1.) 
          
             i. Resigned Member Records
          The scoring record of a member who resigns should be preserved by the former golf club or authorized golf association for at least one year in the event a new golf club may need it.
          The Handicap Index of a resigned member remains valid only until the next revision date at the golf club that issued the Handicap Index. When the player joins a new golf club, See Section 6-7.
          
             j. Corrections in Records and Calculations
          The Handicap Committee must review the accuracy of scoring records and information entered by any computation service. If errors exist, the Committee must investigate and inform the authorized golf association or computation service, which must correct the scoring record as soon as practical and no later than the next revision date. The Handicap Committee must issue a corrected Handicap Index as soon as possible after a scoring error is recognized. A golf club may wish to consult the golf association or computation service for assistance. All reports must be amended to reflect the corrected information. (See Decision  5-2a/2.)
          
             k. Club Handicap Cards
          The Handicap Committee may issue each player a handicap card or label displaying the Handicap Index. (See Section 6-4.)
          
             l. Cooperation With Other Committees
          The Handicap Committee may check periodically and consult with other club Committees, including, but not limited to: 
          • The allocation of handicap-stroke holes on the course according to USGA guidelines (See Section 17);
          • The determination of course set-up and par (See Section 15 and 16);
          • The determination if course conditions are too poor, that score posting should be suspended;
          • Work with the Tournament Committee/Committee in charge of the competition to determine whether scores will be defined as tournament scores (See Section 2, Section 8-2, Section 10, and Decisions 10-3/1 through 10-3/6);
          • The maintenance of playing difficulty of the course (See Section 15);
          • Invocation of any Local Rule on preferred lies (See Section 7-1). 
          In working with other Committees, the Handicap Committee has the responsibility to provide handicap information in a timely manner.
          
             m. Requirements For Compliance
          To determine if a golf club is complying with the USGA Handicap System, use the following checklist (see checklist):
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
           
          If the answer to all questions is "yes," the golf club is following the USGA Handicap System and may issue a Handicap Index. 
          If any answers are "no," the authorized golf association or the USGA should be contacted to determine necessary action to achieve compliance. 
          
            
              
            8-3. Handicap Revisions
          The Handicap Committee at the golf club is responsible for following the revision schedule and procedures of the authorized golf association.
          
             a. Revision Schedule, Frequency of Revisions, and Inactive Season
          A domestic golf club must follow the National Revision Schedule. Under the National Revision Schedule, each Handicap Index must be revised on the 1st and the 15th of each month.
          For an international golf club, each Handicap Index must be revised no less often than once a month and no more often than once every two weeks during the active season in accordance with the revision schedule as established by the authorized golf association that has jurisdiction in its area.
          Each authorized golf association may establish an inactive season for its region (see Section 6-2). If so, it must establish the dates on which the inactive season starts and ends. 
          These dates, along with the National Revision Schedule for Handicap Index revisions, are to be distributed to all member clubs and non-member clubs in the region.
          Any non-member club of an authorized golf association must observe the National Revision Schedule and any inactive season established by the authorized golf association that has jurisdiction in its area.
          A Handicap Index revised on a more frequent schedule, including one updated every time a score is posted, is not a Handicap Index, and must be identified with an "L" to show that it is a local handicap. 
          
             b. Scores Made in Inactive Season
          Scores made in an area when the authorized golf association has declared an inactive season must not be accepted for handicap purposes (e.g., score made in the New York City area in December). However, scores made in an area having an active season (e.g., scores made in Florida in December) must be posted as soon as practicable. 
          
            
              
            8-4. Penalty Scores, Handicap Index Adjustment, and Withdrawal
          
             a. General
          A player must earn a Handicap Index. No player has an inherent right to a Handicap Index without providing full evidence of ability to the golf club's Handicap Committee. A Handicap Index must be changed only as warranted by the USGA Handicap System. Only the Handicap Committee where a player maintains a handicap can adjust that player's Handicap Index. There must be no automatic increases at the beginning of a playing season or year. A Handicap Index is continuous from one playing season or year to the next. (See Decision 8-4a/1 and Section 6-1.)
          
             b. Penalty Scores for Failure to Post
          If a player fails to post an acceptable score as soon as practical after completion of the round, the Handicap Committee has three options:
          1) Post the actual score made by the player;
          2) Post a penalty score equal to the lowest/highest Handicap Differential in the scoring record;
          3) Post the actual score and a penalty score
          The Handicap Committee is not required to notify the player prior to posting a penalty score.
          
             c. Handicap Index Adjustment by Handicap Committee
          The Handicap Committee has the responsibility of making certain that each player has a Handicap Index reflecting potential ability. Under the following circumstances, it will be necessary for the Handicap Committee to adjust the player's Handicap Index. However, the following list is not all-inclusive, and a Handicap Committee has the ultimate authority to adjust a Handicap Index under any circumstance that it feels necessary to do so. Before an adjustment becomes effective, the Handicap Committee must give the player an opportunity to explain the circumstances surrounding the proposed adjustment, either in writing or by appearing before the Committee. When an adjustment does become effective, it must be identified with the letter M, reflecting that the Handicap Committee has modified the Handicap Index (e.g., 4.9M).
          
            
              Note
            : See Appendix B for a sample letter notifying a player of Handicap Index adjustment. 
          
            (i) Improving Faster Than The System Can React
            A player recently taking up the game may improve too rapidly for a Handicap Index calculated by the standard procedure to reflect potential ability. For example, a player who is working on their game by practicing aspects of their game and/or taking playing lessons (see Decision 5-1d/1) may not have a scoring record that exhibits potential ability and may need a Handicap Index adjustment. Also, if the player's Handicap Index is only updated once a month, for example, then the Handicap Committee may consider adjusting the player's Handicap Index to account for the player's improvement within the next month.
          
            (ii) Numerous Away or Internet Scores Change Index
            If a player's Handicap Index increases by 3.0 or more strokes due to the posting of numerous away or Internet scores, and subsequent scores at the player's club clearly indicate that the increased Handicap Index is too high, the Handicap Committee must adjust the player's Handicap Index downward. 
          
            (iii) Temporary Disability
            An increase in a Handicap Index must not be granted because a player's game is temporarily off or the player has discontinued play. However, an increased handicap may be given for a temporary disability. The increased handicap is not a Handicap Index, and it must be identified by the letter "L" to indicate that it is for local use. For example, a player having had recent surgery may be given a higher handicap while recovering. (See Decisions 8-4c/1, 8-4c/2, and local handicap.)
          
            (iv) Player Manipulates Round
            The Handicap Committee must adjust or withdraw the Handicap Index of a player who manipulates scores. (See Section 8-4f.) Examples of manipulating scores include the following: 
          (a) Posting erroneous information to the scoring record; 
          (b) Stopping play after 6 holes to avoid posting scores; 
          
            (c) Repeatedly playing more than one ball to avoid posting scores; 
          
          (d) Not adjusting hole scores under Section 4; 
          (e) Deliberately reporting more or fewer strokes than actually scored; 
          (f) Deliberately taking extra strokes to inflate a score. 
          (g) Not observing either or both of the two basic premises that underlie the USGA Handicap System (see Section 1-1)
          
            (v) Continued violations of Section 5-1e.
            The Handicap Committee is responsible for identifying and notifying a player who regularly violates any provision within Section 5-1e that such rounds are unacceptable for handicap purposes. If the player persists in violating clause(s) within Section 5-1e after being notified by the Handicap Committee, the Handicap Committee is authorized and encouraged to consider withdrawal of the player's Handicap Index. 
          
             d. Duration of Adjustment by Handicap Committee
          The Handicap Committee must determine how long a player's Handicap Index is to remain modified or withdrawn. At each handicap revision date, the Handicap Committee should compare the modified Handicap Index to the value determined by the normal computation method under Section 10-2. For example, the Handicap Committee may lift a modified Handicap Index of 4.9M, when subsequent scores posted to a player's scoring record produce a lower Handicap Index (e.g., 4.0).
          
             e. Tournament Performance Review
          The Handicap Committee must review the reduction of a player's Handicap Index for exceptional tournament scores. The procedure for reducing a player's Handicap Index is explained in Section 10-3 and is an automatic calculation. 
          
            After each handicap revision, the 
            
              Handicap Committee
            
             should re-evaluate the player's reduced Handicap Index under Section 10-3, choosing one of the following:
          • Continue to allow the reduction to run its normal course, as described in Section 10-3d, or
          • Further reduce the Handicap Index (See Section 10-3e), or 
          • Override the reduction. For example, the Handicap Committee may override, or cancel a reduction of the Handicap Index of a player who has returned, say, 50 tournament scores, and whose Handicap Index reduction was based on early scores.
          
             f. Handicap Index Withdrawal
          The Handicap Committee must withdraw the Handicap Index of a player who repeatedly fails to meet the player responsibilities under the USGA Handicap System. Before any action is taken, the player must be advised of the information available to the Handicap Committee and be invited to respond to the Handicap Committee either in writing or by appearing in person. A withdrawn Handicap Index may be reinstated under conditions set forth by the Handicap Committee. (See Decision 5-2a/4.)

          Section 9 HANDICAP COMPETITIONS
          Definitions....
          Within each section, all defined terms are in italics and are listed alphabetically in Section 2 - Definitions.
          
            9-1. Handicap Required for Competition
          The USGA recommends that a player have a Handicap Index in order to enter competitions conducted by a golf association, golf club, and any other organization. (See Decisions 9-1/1, 9-1/2.)
          
             a. Effective Date of Handicap Required
          When a Handicap Index is a requirement for entering a competition, a player must submit the Handicap Index in effect on the date of entry.
          
             b. Handicap Index Changed by Committee
          A Handicap Index adjusted by the Handicap Committee is the player's Handicap Index unless noted otherwise in the manual. (See local handicap, Sections 3-4, 8-4c, 8-4d, f, and 10-3e.) 
          
            9-2. Handicap Index to Use
          
             a. At the Start of the Competition
          The Handicap Index to be used at the start of a competition must be determined by the Committee in charge of the competition. The USGA recommends that the Committee require use of a Handicap Index in effect on the date the competition commences.
          
             b. Changes During the Competition
          Whether a player's Course Handicap may be changed during a competition is a matter for the Committee in charge of the competition to determine and publish prior to the competition. Rule 33-1 of "The Rules of Golf" provides in part: that the Committee must lay down the conditions under which a competition is to be played. 
          The Committee may, in an exceptional individual case, modify a player's Course Handicap before or between rounds of the competition; however, a player's Handicap Index can only be adjusted by the player's Handicap Committee. (See Section 8-4c.)
          The USGA recommends that, when practical, each player use the Handicap Index in effect at the time each round is played. If a competition spans a handicap revision date, the revised Handicap Index should be used in rounds following that date. (See Decision 9-2b/1)
          
             c. Player Has More Than One Handicap Index
          If a player belongs to more than one golf club and has a different Handicap Index at each golf club, the Committee in charge of a competition should require the player to use the lowest Handicap Index when competing with players from more than one club. (See Section 6-5 and Decision 6-5/2 and Decision 6-5/3.)
          
            9-3. Assignment of Strokes
          
             a. Where To Apply Strokes
          If handicap strokes are applied to a gross score, subtract the player's handicap strokes (usually the Course Handicap) recorded on the scorecard. The result is the player's net score.
          In stroke play, the Committee is responsible for the addition of scores and the application of the  Course Handicap recorded on the score card.  ("The Rules of Golf," Rule 33-5).
          For formats in which handicap strokes are used on specific holes during the course of play, a player generally takes them in the order assigned on the scorecard. For example, a player receiving three strokes takes them on the first, second, and third stroke holes. However, the Committee in charge of the competition is permitted to assign a custom order. If so, it must publish a "stroke allocation table" indicating the order of holes at which handicap strokes are to be given or received. For example, while the score card may assign holes 3, 13, and 8 as the first, second, and third stroke holes, the Committee may choose to designate 4, 12, and 7 instead. ("The Rules of Golf," Rule 33-4).
          In mixed competitions where players play their own ball and where allocations are different for men and women, the players receive strokes based on their respective stroke allocations.
          In mixed foursome and selected drive match play competitions, strokes are received based on the men's allocation.
          
             b. Where to Apply Strokes, Plus Handicaps
          A player with a plus Course Handicap must add strokes according to the allocation table beginning with the 18th stroke hole. For example, when a player with a plus Course Handicap competes in a partnership stroke play competition, a side with a Course Handicap of plus 1 must add a stroke to its score on the hole designated as the 18th stroke hole. In a match play competition, if the lower-handicapped side has a Course Handicap of plus 1, that side plays at scratch, and adds 1 stroke to the other side's Course Handicap. (See Decisions 9-3a/1, 9-3a/2, and 9-3a/3.)
          When a plus-handicap player is part of a side, the percentage allowances, for different types of play (as described in Section 9-4), bring that player's Course Handicap closer to zero (e.g., 50% of a +3 is a +1.5, which rounds to +1). This occurs in order to keep as close as possible the proper percentage spread between the plus-handicap player and the other members of the side.
          
            Example: On side A-B, Player A has a Course Handicap of +5 and Player B has a Course Handicap of 10. The total spread between Course Handicap is 15 strokes. In a competition where 80% of each player's Course Handicap is used, Player A becomes a +4 (+5 x 80%) and Player B becomes an 8 (10 x 80%). The spread between Course Handicap, after the allowance is 12, which is 80% of their original spread of 15.
          
             c. Players Competing From Different Tees or Men and Women From Same Tees
          
            (i) Different Tees: Men vs. Men; Women vs. Women; Women vs. Men
            Different tees usually have different ratings. Since a USGA Course Rating reflects the probable scores of scratch golfers, the higher-rated course is more difficult, and the player playing from the set of tees with the higher USGA Course Rating receives additional stroke(s) equal to the difference between each USGA Course Rating, with the resulting figure rounded off to the nearest whole number (.5 or more is rounded upward). (See Decision 3-5/1.) Example 1: If men playing from the middle tees, from which the men's USGA Course Rating is 70.3, compete against men playing from the back tees, from which the men's USGA Course Rating is 72.6, the men playing from the back tees will add two strokes (72.6 - 70.3 = 2.3 rounded to 2) to Course Handicap.Example 2: If women playing from the forward tees, from which the women's USGA Course Rating is 73.4, compete against men playing from the middle tees, from which the men's USGA Course Rating is 70.9, the women will add three strokes (73.4 - 70.9 = 2.5 rounded to 3) to Course Handicap.
          
            (ii) Same Tees: Men vs. Women
            Men and women playing from the same set of tees will have different ratings. Since the women's USGA Course Rating usually will be higher, women receive additional strokes equal to the difference between men's and women's USGA Course Rating, with the resulting figure rounded off to the nearest whole number (.5 or more is rounded upward). (See Decision 3-5/1 for an exception.)Example: If women playing from the middle tees, from which the women's USGA Course Rating is 77.3, compete against men playing from the same tees, from which the men's USGA Course Rating is 70.9, the women will add six strokes (77.3 - 70.9 = 6.4 or 6) to Course Handicap.
          
            (iii) Foursome Competitions Using Different Tees or Men and Women Using Same Tees
            In foursome competitions using different tees or men and women from the same tees, players use half the difference in USGA Course Rating between sets of tees. Example: A, a man, and B, a woman, are partners in a foursome competition against C, a man, and D, a woman. The men play the white tees with a USGA Course Rating of 71.2, and the women play the red tees with a USGA Course Rating of 73.6. The difference in Ratings is 2.4. After the Course Handicap of each team is determined, one-half of the difference between Ratings (1 stroke) is added to the Course Handicap of each team with the resulting figure rounded off to the nearest whole number (.5 or more is rounded upward). If A and B are both men, the procedure applies only to side C and D (a man and a woman).In a foursome competition in which sides are using different tees, the side playing from the set of tees with the higher USGA Course Rating receives additional strokes equal to the difference between Ratings with the resulting figure rounded off to the nearest whole number (.5 or more is rounded upward). (See Decision 3-5/1.)Example: A, a man, and C, a man, are partners in a foursome competition against B, a woman, and D, a woman. The men play the white tees, with a USGA Course Rating of 71.2, and the women play the red tees, with a USGA Course Rating of 73.6. The difference in Rating is 2.4. After the Course Handicap of each team is determined, the full difference between the Ratings (2 strokes) is added to the Course Handicap of the women's team.Note: Additional strokes received under this procedure are to be disregarded when applying ESC for handicap purposes. (See Section 4-3, Example 3.)
          
            9-4. Handicap Allowances
          
            
              Handicap allowances
             have no effect in determining a Handicap Index; however, their use is recommended to produce fair and equitable competition.
          A Handicap Index relates to 18 holes.  Each allowance in Section 9-4 applies to an 18-hole round, even though the competition may consist of more than one round.
          The allowances are designed to make all forms of play fair. In some forms of play, it is equitable for players to use full Course Handicap. In some team competitions, using full Course Handicap would give higher-handicapped sides an advantage over lower-handicapped sides. Less than full Course Handicap is recommended in some team competitions.
          To make proper use of handicap allowances, follow the order of the steps below:
          Step 1: Players must first determine Course Handicap (from tees played).
          Step 2: Players should then apply the handicap allowances for the appropriate format.
          Step 3: It is recommended that in four-ball stroke play competitions, if the Course Handicap of the side differ by more than eight strokes, each is reduced by 10 percent. (See Note in Section 9-4b(ii).) 
          Step 4: If players are competing from different tees or men and women are competing from the same tees (See Sections 3-5 and 9-3c), players must apply the adjustment for the difference in USGA Course Rating from the tees played.
          For example, a competition in which players using a handicap allowance of 80 percent are playing from two sets of tees where the difference in USGA Course Rating is four strokes. Player A's Course Handicap of 30 is first reduced by six strokes to 24 (30 x 80% = 24), then increased by four strokes to 28 (24 + 4 = 28). Had the order of adjustment been incorrectly reversed, A's Course Handicap of 30 would first have been increased by four strokes to 34 (30 + 4 = 34), then reduced by seven strokes to 27 (34 x 80% = 27.2, rounded downward to 27) - a loss of one stroke.
          The amount of the adjustment in Step 4 is added to Course Handicap, even if it causes a Course Handicap to exceed the maximum Handicap Index possible for the Slope Rating of the set of tees being played. (See Section 3-4.)
          
            Note 1: In a match play formats where the lower-handicapped player plays at scratch, and due to Step 4 is not at scratch, repeat Step 2 if necessary.
          
            Note 2: If the percentage of a player's Course Handicap results in a decimal in Steps 2 and/or 3 above, the resulting figure is rounded to the nearest whole number (.5 or more is rounded upward).
          
             a. Match Play
          In match play, the game is played by holes. Except as otherwise provided in "The Rules of Golf," a hole is won by the side that holes its ball in fewer strokes. In a handicap match, the lower net score wins the hole. A match (which consists of a stipulated round, unless otherwise decreed by the Committee) is won by the side which is leading by a number of holes greater than the number of holes remaining to be played. The Committee may, for the purpose of settling a tie, extend the stipulated round to as many holes as are required for a match to be won ("The Rules of Golf," 2-1, 2-3). The Committee must also determine the proper handicap allowances before adjusting for competitions from different tees or in competitions between men and women from the same tees. (See Section 9-3c.)
          
            (i) Singles Match Play
            In singles match play, the match is won by the player who is leading by a number of holes greater than the number of holes remaining to be played. After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees. Allowance: The higher-handicapped player receives the full difference in Course Handicap between the two players; the lower-handicapped player plays from scratch. (See Decision 9-4a/1 and 9-4a/3.)Example: A player with a Course Handicap of 17 receives four strokes from a player with a Course Handicap of 13. The player receives them on the first four allocated handicap-stroke holes.
          
            (ii) Singles Match Play vs. Par or Bogey
            Bogey or par competitions are forms of competition in which play is against a fixed score at each hole. The scoring is made as in match play. Any hole for which a competitor returns no score must be regarded as a loss. The winner is the competitor who is most successful in the aggregate of holes ("The Rules of Golf," 32-1). After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees. Allowance: Each player receives full Course Handicap.Example: Player A with a Course Handicap of 17 receives one stroke on the first 17 handicap-stroke holes.
          
            (iii) Four-Ball Match Play
            In four-ball match play, two play their better ball against the better ball of two other players ("The Rules of Golf," Rule 30 and Definitions). After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees. Allowance: The Course Handicap of all four players is reduced by the Course Handicap of the player with the lowest handicap, who then plays from scratch. Each of the three other players is allowed 100 percent of the difference. (See Decisions 9-4a/2).Example: Players A, B, C, and D have a Course Handicap of 5, 10, 15 and 20, respectively. Player A plays at scratch, B receives 5 strokes, C receives 10 strokes, and D receives 15 strokes.In mixed four-ball match play, strokes are taken as assigned on the players' respective stroke allocation table. The Committee in charge of the competition designates the tees to be played (see Section 9-3a).
          
            (iv) Four-Ball Match Play vs. Par or Bogey
            In four-ball match play vs. par or bogey, two play their better ball against par or bogey at each hole. The winner is the team who is most successful in the aggregate of holes. After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees. Allowance: Men receive 90 percent of Course Handicap; Women receive 95 percent of Course Handicap.Example: On men's side A-B, Player A with a Course Handicap of 10 would receive 9 strokes (10 x 90% = 9) and Player B with a Course Handicap of 16 would receive 14 strokes (16 x 90% = 14.4, rounded to 14). Strokes are taken as assigned on the players' respective stroke allocation table.
          
            (v) Total Score of Partners Match Play
            Two players form a side, and play their own ball. The combined total of their scores for each hole is the score recorded for the side. After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c must be applied in competitions from different tees or in competitions between men and women from the same tees. Allowance: The Course Handicap of all four players is reduced by the Course Handicap of the player with the lowest Course Handicap, who must then play from scratch. Each of the three other players is allowed 100 percent of the difference.Example: Side A-B is comprised of Player A with a Course Handicap of 5 and Player B with a Course Handicap of 10. Side C-D is comprised of Player C with a Course Handicap of 15 and Player D with a Course Handicap of 20. Player A plays at scratch, B receives 5 strokes, C receives 10 strokes, and D receives 15 strokes.
          
            (vi) Best-Ball-of-Four Match Play vs. Par or Bogey
            In best-ball-of-four match play vs. par or bogey, four play their best ball against par or bogey at each hole. The winner is the team that is most successful in the aggregate of holes. After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees. Allowance: Men receive 80 percent of Course Handicap; Women receive 90 percent of Course Handicap.Example: Men's side A-B-C-D with a respective Course Handicapof 5, 10, 15, and 20 would each receive 80 percent of their Course Handicap (4, 8, 12, and 16 respectively). Their best net ball of the four would then be used to score vs. par or bogey. Strokes are taken as assigned on the players' respective stroke allocation table.
          
            (vii) Foursome Match Play
            In a foursome match, two play against two and each side plays one ball. In a foursome during any stipulated round the partners play alternately from the teeing grounds and alternately during the play of each hole ("The Rules of Golf," Definition of Foursome and Rule 29-1). After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c(iii) must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees. Allowance: The allowance for the higher-handicapped side is 50 percent of the difference between the combined Course Handicap of each side. (When selected drives are permitted, the allowance is 40 percent.) The lower handicapped side competes at scratch. Example: Side A-B with a combined Course Handicap of 15 competes against side C-D with a combined Course Handicap of 36. The higher handicapped side, C-D, receives 11 strokes (36 - 15 = 21 x 50% = 10.5 rounded to 11). Strokes are taken as assigned on the players' respective stroke allocation table.
          
            (viii) Foursome Match Play vs. Par or Bogey
            In foursome match play vs. par or bogey, a match is played against par or bogey. The winner is the side that is most successful in the aggregate of holes. After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c(iii) must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees. Allowance: The allowance is 50 percent of the partners' combined Course Handicap. (When selected drives are permitted, the allowance is 40 percent.)Example: On side A-B, Player A has a Course Handicap of 5 and Player B has a Course Handicap of 10. Side A-B receives 8 strokes (15 x 50% = 7.5, rounded to 8). Strokes are taken as assigned on the players' respective stroke allocation table.
          
            (ix) Chapman or Pinehurst Match Play
            In a Chapman or Pinehurst match, two play against two. Each partner plays from the teeing ground, but plays the partner's ball for the second shot. After the second shot, partners select the ball with which they wish to score, and play that ball alternately to complete the hole. After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c(iii) must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees. Allowance: The partner with the lower Course Handicap receives 60 percent of Course Handicap. The partner with the higher Course Handicap receives 40 percent of Course Handicap. The side with the higher Course Handicap receives the difference between the Course Handicap of each side. The lower-handicapped side plays from scratch.Example: Side A-B is comprised of Player A with a Course Handicap of 5 and Player B with a Course Handicap of 10. Player A (5 x 60% = 3) + Player B (10 x 40% = 4) = 7 strokes for side A-B (3 + 4 = 7). Side C-D is comprised of Player C with a Course Handicap of 14 and Player D with a Course Handicap of 17. Player C (14 x 60% = 8.4 rounded to 8) + Player D (17 x 40% = 6.8 rounded to 7) = 15. Side A-B plays at scratch and Side C-D receives one stroke per hole on the first 8 allocated handicap-stroke holes.
          
             b. Stroke Play
          The competitor who plays the stipulated round or rounds in the fewest net strokes is the winner ("The Rules of Golf," 3-1). After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees.
          
            (i) Individual Stroke Play
            Allowance: Each competitor receives full Course Handicap (A plus Course Handicap must be added to the gross score to determine the net score.)Example: Player A has a Course Handicap of 10 and scores 82. A's net score is 72. Player B has a Course Handicap of +2 and scores 70. Player B's net score is 72.
          
            (ii) Four-Ball Stroke Play
            In four-ball stroke play, two competitors play as partners, each playing their own ball. The lower of the partners' scores is the score for the hole ("The Rules of Golf," Rule 31 and Definition of Four Ball). After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees. Allowance: Men receive 90 percent of Course Handicap; Women receive 95 percent of Course Handicap.Example 1: On men's side A-B, Player A has a Course Handicap of 5 and Player B has a Course Handicap of 20. At 90 percent of Course Handicap, Player A receives 5 strokes (5 x 90% = 4.5, rounded to 5) and Player B receives 18 strokes (20 x 90% = 18). In mixed four-ball stroke play, strokes are taken as assigned on the players' respective stroke allocation table, and players must play from the sets of tees designated by the Committee in charge of the competition.Example 2: If men are playing the middle tees and women are playing the forward tees, strokes must be taken by men as they are allocated from the middle tees and by women as they are allocated from the forward tees.Note: It is recommended that the Committee considers it a condition of four-ball stroke play competitions that the Course Handicap (after allowance) of the members of a side may not differ by more than eight strokes. A side with a large difference has an advantage over a side with a small Course Handicap difference. If a difference of more than eight strokes cannot be avoided, it is suggested that an additional 10 percent reduction be applied to the Course Handicap of each member of the advantaged side.Example 3: In Example 1, there is more than an eight stroke difference between partners (after allowance, 18 - 5 = 13). Therefore, both players would then be reduced an additional 10 percent based on the rounded Course Handicap. Player A receives 5 strokes (5 x 10% = .5; 5 - .5 = 4.5, rounded to 5) and Player B receives 16 strokes (18 x 10% = 1.8; 18 - 1.8 = 16.2, rounded to 16.) Strokes are taken as assigned on the players' respective stroke allocation table.
          
            (iii) Total Score of Partners Stroke Play
            In total score of partners stroke play, two players form a side, and each plays their own ball. The combined total of the partner's scores for the round is the score for the side. After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees.Allowance: Partners receive full combined Course Handicap.Example: Player A has a Course Handicap of 12 and scores 87. Player B, A's partner, has a Course Handicap of 26 and scores 101. The team score is: (87 - 12) + (101 - 26) = 75 + 75 = 150.
          
            (iv) Best-Ball-of-Four Stroke Play
            In best-ball-of-four stroke play, four players play as a side, each playing their own ball. The lowest score of the side is the score for the hole. After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees.Allowance: Men receive 80 percent of Course Handicap; Women receive 90 percent of Course Handicap.Example: On a mixed side A-B-C-D (A,B men, C,D women), Player A with a Course Handicap of 8 receives 6 strokes (8 x 80% = 6.4, rounded to 6). Player B with a Course Handicap of 10 receives 8 strokes (10 x 80% =8). Player C with a Course Handicap of 12 receives 11 strokes (12 x 90% = 10.8, rounded to 11). Player D with a Course Handicap of 14 receives 13 strokes (14 x 90% = 12.6, rounded to 13).The lowest net score for each hole is then used to determine the overall score for the stipulated round. Strokes are taken as assigned on the players' respective stroke allocation table. 
          
            (v) Two-Best-Balls-of-Four Stroke Play
            In two-best-balls-of-four stroke play, four players each play their own ball and the two best balls on each hole is the score for the hole. After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees.Allowance: Men receive 90 percent of Course Handicap; Women receive 95 percent of Course Handicap.Example: On women's side A-B-C-D, Player A with a Course Handicap of 11 receives 10 strokes (11 x 95% = 10.45, rounded to 10). Player B with a Course Handicap of 16 receives 15 strokes (16 x 95% = 15.2, rounded to 15). Player C with a Course Handicap of 22 receives 21 strokes (22 x 95%= 20.9, rounded to 21). Player D with a Course Handicap of 35 receives 33 strokes (35 x 95% = 33.25, rounded to 33). Strokes are taken as assigned on the players' respective stroke allocation table.
          
            (vi) Foursome Stroke Play
            In foursome stroke play, two players form a side and the partners play one ball. The partners play alternately from the teeing grounds and alternately during the play of each hole ("The Rules of Golf," 29-1). After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c(iii) must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees.Allowance: The allowance is 50 percent of the partners' combined Course Handicap. When selected drives are permitted, the allowance is 40 percent. A plus combined Course Handicap side must be added to the gross score to determine the net score. Example: On side A-B, Player A has a Course Handicap of 5 and Player B has a Course Handicap of 12. Side AB's combined Course Handicap is 17. Side A-B will receive 9 strokes (17 x 50% = 8.5, rounded to 9).
          
            (vii) Chapman or Pinehurst Stroke Play
            In Chapman or Pinehurst stroke play, two players play as partners, each partner plays from the teeing ground and plays the partner's ball for the second shot. After the second shot, partners select the ball with which they wish to score and play that ball alternately to complete the hole. After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c must be applied in competitions from different tees or in competitions between men and women from the same tees. Allowance: The player with the lower Course Handicap is allowed 60 percent of Course Handicap. The player with the higher Course Handicap is allowed 40 percent of Course Handicap. Example: On side A-B, Player A has a Course Handicap of 10 and Player B has a Course Handicap of 18. 60% of Player A's Course Handicap is 6 (10 x 60%) and 40% of Player B's Course Handicap is 7 (18 x 40% = 7.2, rounded to 7) so the total is 13. Side A-B will receive 13 strokes.
          
            (viii) Stableford Competition
            The scoring in Stableford competitions is made by points awarded in relation to a fixed score (usually par or net par) at each hole as shown below: 
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
          
            The winner is the competitor who scores the highest number of points ("The Rules of Golf," 32-1b). After handicap allowances are determined, Section 9-3c must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees.Allowance: Players use full Course Handicap, and strokes are taken as they are allocated on the stroke allocation table.Example: Player A has a Course Handicap of 16 in a Stableford competition based on net scores with par as the fixed score. Player A's gross score of 5 on a par 4 allocated as the 15th handicap-stroke hole results in a net score of 4 (par). Player A receives two points for the hole.
          
             c. Course Handicap Allowance Table
          The following table gives the adjusted Course Handicap for allowances recommended above.
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
           
          
            9-5. How To Decide Ties In Handicap Competitions
          ("The Rules of Golf," Appendix I)
          For reference purposes, a "side" is a player, or two or more players who are partners. A side is considered synonymous with the term "team."
          Rule 33-6 empowers the Committee in charge of the competition to determine how and when a tie is decided. The decision should be published in advance.
          The USGA recommends:
          
            (i) Match Play
            A match that ends all square should be played off hole by hole until one side wins a hole. The playoff should start on the hole where the match began. In a handicap match, handicap strokes should be allowed as in the stipulated round.
          
            (ii) Stroke Play
            In the event of a tie in a handicap stroke play competition a play-off with handicaps is recommended. The playoff may be over 18 holes or a smaller number of holes as specified by the Committee. It is recommended that any such playoff consist of at least three holes.If the playoff is less than 18 holes and is a form of play where the stroke-hole allocation is not relevant, such as individual stroke play, the percentage of 18 holes to be played should be applied to the players' Course Handicap for the playoff. Fractions of one-half stroke or more should count as a full stroke; any lesser fraction should be disregarded. Example 1: In an individual stroke play competition, A has a Course Handicap of 10 and B a Course Handicap of 7. If the Committee decides to conduct a nine-hole play-off (50 percent of 18 holes), A will deduct 5 strokes from his score B will deduct 4 from his score.If the playoff is less than 18 holes and is a form of play where the stroke-hole allocation is relevant, such as four-ball stroke play and Stableford, handicap strokes should be taken as they were assigned for the competition, using the players' respective stroke allocation tables. Example 2: In a four-ball stroke play competition, side A-B consists of A with a Course Handicap of 10 and B with a Course Handicap of 7 (after allowances). If the stroke hole allocation is assigned so that the odd stroke holes are allocated to the front nine and the even stroke holes are allocated to the back nine and the playoff is conducted over the back nine, A receives one stroke on the holes allocated 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 (for five total strokes) and B receives one stroke on the holes allocated 2, 4, and 6 (for three total strokes).
          
            (iii) Playoff Not Feasible; Matching Scorecards
            If a playoff of any type is not feasible, matching scorecards is recommended. The method of matching cards should be announced in advance and should also provide what will happen if this procedure does not produce a winner. An acceptable method of matching cards is to determine the winner on the basis of the best score for the last nine holes. If the tying players have the same score for the last nine, determine the winner on the basis of the last six holes, last three holes and finally the 18th hole. If this method is used in a competition with a multiple tee start, it is recommended that the "last nine holes, last six holes, etc." is considered to be holes 10-18, 13-18, etc.For competitions where the stroke-hole allocation is not relevant, such as individual stroke play, if the last nine, last six, last three holes card matching is used, one-half, one-third, one-sixth, etc. of the Course Handicap should be deducted from the score for those holes. Fractions of one-half stroke or more should count as a full stroke; any lesser fractions should be disregarded.
           
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
           
          Player E and F have an equal 18-hole net total.
          Last nine holes: E: 11 x .5 = 5.5, rounded to 6. 40 - 6 = 34; F: 10 x .5 = 5. 39 - 5 = 34.
          Last six holes: E: 11 x .33 = 3.63, rounded to 4. 25 (gross score for last six holes) - 4 = 21; F: 10 x .33 = 3.3, rounded to 3. 26 - 3 = 23. E wins the matching of cards.
          In competitions where the stroke hole allocation is relevant, such as four-ball stroke play, match play, match play vs. par or bogey and Stableford, handicap strokes should be taken as they were assigned for the competition, using the players' respective stoke allocation tables.
          
            Example 4: In a four-ball stroke play competition, if the Committee decides to match scorecards for the last nine holes, it would determine each side's score for the last nine holes using the lower partner's net scores for each hole. This method results in a tie at 34. Side A-B has a score of 23 for the last six holes, C-D a score of 21, thus C-D win the match of score cards.

      <body>
          Section 10 USGA HANDICAP FORMULA
          Definitions
          Within each section, all defined terms are in italics and are listed alphabetically in Section 2 - Definitions.
          Potential ability is defined by the term Handicap Index and is measured through a calculation using the player's best scores. These best scores are determined by calculating the Handicap Differential for each score. The Handicap Index is calculated by taking 96 percent of the average of the best Handicap Differential(s), and applying Section 10-3 for players with two or more eligible tournament scores.
          
            10-1. Calculation of Handicap Differentials 
          A Handicap Differential is computed from four elements: adjusted gross score, USGA Course Rating, Slope Rating, and 113 (the Slope Rating of a course of standard difficulty). To determine the Handicap Differential, subtract the USGA Course Rating from the adjusted gross score; multiply the difference by 113; and divide the resulting number by the Slope Rating. Round the final number to the nearest tenth.
          
            
              Handicap Differential
             = (Adjusted Gross Score - USGA Course Rating) x 113 / Slope Rating
          
          
             a. Plus Handicap Differential
          When the adjusted gross score is higher than the USGA Course Rating, the Handicap Differential is a positive number. The following is an example for determining a Handicap Differential using an adjusted gross score of 95 made on a course with a USGA Course Rating of 71.5 and a Slope Rating of 125:
          
            
              
                
                  
                    Adjusted Gross Score
                   - USGA Course Rating:
                
                  95 - 71.5 = 23.5
                
              
              
                
                  Difference x Standard Slope Rating:
                
                
                  23.5 x 113 = 2655.5
                
              
              
                
                  Result / Slope Rating:
                
                
                  
                    2655.5 / 125 = 21.24
                  
                
              
              
                
                  
                    Handicap Differential
                   (rounded):
                
                  21.2
                
              
            
          
          
          
             b. Minus Handicap Differential
          When the adjusted gross score is lower than the USGA Course Rating, the Handicap Differential is a negative number. The following is an example for determining a Handicap Differential using an adjusted gross score of 69 made on a course with a USGA Course Rating of 71.5 and a Slope Rating of 125:
          
            
              
                
                  
                    
                      Adjusted Gross Score
                     - USGA Course Rating:
                
                
                  
                    69 - 71.5 = -2.5 
                  
                
              
              
                
                  
                    Difference x Standard Slope Rating:
                  
                
                
                  
                    -2.5 x 113 = -282.5 
                  
                
              
              
                
                  
                    Result / Slope Rating:
                  
                
                
                  
                    -282.5 / 125 = -2.26
                  
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                      Handicap Differential
                     (rounded):
                
                
                  
                    -2.3 
                  
                
              
            
          
          
          
            10-2. Handicap Index Formula
          The Handicap Index formula is based on the best Handicap Differential(s) in a player's scoring record. If a player's scoring record contains 20 scores, the best 10 Handicap Differentials of the most recent 20 scores are used to calculate the Handicap Index. As the number of scores in the scoring record decreases, the percentage of scores used in a scoring record decreases from the maximum of the best 50 percent. If the scoring record contains 9 or 10 scores, only the best three scores (30 to 33 percent) in the scoring record will be used. Thus, the accuracy of a player's Handicap Index is directly proportional to the number of acceptable scores posted. A Handicap Index must not be issued to a player who has returned fewer than five acceptable scores. The following procedures illustrate how an authorized golf association, golf club, and computation services calculate a player's Handicap Index.
          The procedure for calculating a Handicap Index is as follows:
          
            Step 1: Use the table below to determine the number of Handicap Differential(s) to use:
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
            
          
            Step 2: Determine Handicap Differential(s);
          
            Step 3: Average the Handicap Differential(s) being used; 
          
            Step 4: Multiply the average by .96*; 
          
            Step 5:  Delete all numbers after the tenths' digit (truncate). Do not round to the nearest tenth. 
          
            
              Example 1: Fewer than 20 scores (11 scores available).
          
            
              
                
                  Total of lowest 4 Handicap Differentials:

                  Multiply average by .96:
                
                
                  24.984
                
              
              
                
                  Delete all numbers after  
            the tenth digit (truncate).  
            Do not round to the nearest tenth:
                
                
                  24.9
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                      Handicap Index
                    :
                
                
                  24.9
                
              
            
          
           
          * Bonus for Excellence is the incentive for players to improve their golf games that is built into the USGA Handicap System. It is the term used to describe the small percentage below perfect equity that is used to calculate a Handicap Index (96 percent). As a Handicap Index improves (gets lower), the player has a slightly better chance of placing high or winning  
        a handicap event.
          
            
              Example 2: Twenty scores available. The following is an example of a Handicap Index calculation for a player with 20 scores.

          Using the definition of a tournament score (see tournament score and Decisions 10-3/1 through 10-3/6), the Committee (preferably the Handicap Committee in consultation with the Committee in charge of the competition) must determine in advance whether a score is to be designated as a tournament score that is to be identified by the letter "T" when posted (e.g., 82T). These scores are often referred to as "T-Scores" as in Section 10-3c.
          
             a. Procedure
          The following procedure must be used as an alternate calculation of a Handicap Index for players with two or more eligible tournament scores. A player's Handicap Index may be reduced under this procedure when a player has a minimum of two eligible tournament score differentials that are at least 3.0 better than the player's Handicap Index calculated under Section 10-2. 
          The Handicap Committee or handicap computation service must apply the following steps to determine if there is a reduction in Handicap Index calculated under Section 10-2.
          
             b. Steps
          
            
              Example:
             A player with a Handicap Index of 17.3 has three eligible tournament scores, an 82T, 83T and 85T. Two of these eligible tournament scores, an 82T and 83T, produce the lowest tournament score differentials. They were made on a course with a USGA Course Rating of 70.6 and a Slope Rating of 130.
          
            Step 1: Calculate tournament score differentials by subtracting the USGA Course Rating from each eligible tournament score; multiply the result by 113, and divide by the Slope Rating for each course played. Select the two lowest eligible tournament score differentials.
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
          
            Step 2: Subtract the second lowest differential from the Handicap Index under Section 10-2. Continue with the next step if the result is 3.0 or greater. 
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
           
          
            Step 3: Average the two lowest tournament score differentials.
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
          
            
          
           2 best T-score Differential average of 
        differentials 2 lowest T-scores
          
            Step 4: Subtract that average from the player's Handicap Index. 
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
           
          
            Step 5: Using the number (rounded to the nearest tenths place (7.0) from step 4 and the total number of tournament scores in the player's record (3), use the Handicap Reduction Table to determine the amount the player's Handicap Index is to be reduced. 
          
            Step 6: Subtract the table value from the player's Handicap Index. The result of that subtraction will be the player's reduced Handicap Index, provided that it is at least 1.0 less than the Handicap Index based on the formula in Section 10-2. The reduced Handicap Index is to be identified with the letter R when displayed in handicap reports or on the computer screen, e.g., 12.3R. 
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
          
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
           
          
            
              Example
            :
           Value from Handicap Reduction Table 5.0 
          
            
              Handicap Index
             -- Table Value: 17.3 - 5.0 = 12.3 
           Reduced Handicap Index: 12.3R 
          
             c. Counting Tournament Scores
          (i) T-Score Counter -- The number of eligible tournament scores will be counted on a revolving twelve-month basis. In order to keep track of the counter, but not save every T-Score, a counter for each month is needed. The T-Score counter will contain the sum of the latest twelve monthly counters plus any T-Scores older than one year that are a part of the twenty score history. The monthly counter will increase based on the date a score is processed, not the date of the score. 
          (ii) Best T-Score File -- Up to the best six eligible tournament scores are saved in a "Best T-Score File," separate from the player's handicap record of the latest 20 scores. 
          (iii) Adding T-Scores -- When a new tournament score is posted, it becomes part of the player's normal handicap record as a score and Handicap Differential. If the "Best T-Score File" has fewer than six eligible tournament scores, the new T-Score is added to that file. If the file already has six T-Scores, the new T-Score, if better than any T-Score in the file, is added to the file and the worst T-Score in the file is deleted, regardless of the date of the T-Score. 
          (iv) Discarding Old T-Scores -- At each handicap revision, each  
        T-Score in the "Best T-Score File" is checked to see if the score is older than one year and no longer part of the player's current twenty score history. If so, the score is deleted from the file. Deleted T-Scores are replaced by the best eligible tournament score (if any) in the player's handicap record that are not already in the "Best T-Score File." 
          
             d. Duration and Variation of Reduction
          
            
              Handicap Index
             reduction for exceptional tournament scores is calculated at each handicap revision and may vary from revision to revision based on a number of factors. These factors may include the following:
          • Additional tournament scores;
          • Expiration of eligible tournament scores;
          • Variation in 10-2 calculation; 
          • Fluctuation of 10-2 calculation in relation to the two lowest T-Scores. 
          
             e. Handicap Committee Review of Reduction
          The Handicap Committee must review all reductions. As a result of review, the Handicap Committee may:
          • Continue to allow the reduction to run its normal course, as described in Section 10-3d, or
          • Further reduce the Handicap Index. For example, the Committee may conclude that the player's performance continues to be better than the potential ability indicated by the 10-3 reduction. In that case, the Committee replaces the reduced Handicap Index with an even lower reduced Handicap Index, continuing to review the reduction after each revision period (See Section 8-4e), or
          • Override the reduction. For example, the Committee may cancel the reduction to a Handicap Index for a player who has been injured and whose reduction was based on early tournament scores prior to the injury. In that case, the reduction is inconsistent with the player's scoring record. The Committee replaces the reduced Handicap Index with the Handicap Index calculated under 10-2 and ceases designating it with an R. The Committee will have the option to continue to override after each revision period for as long as at least two exceptional tournament scores continue to trigger a 10-3 reduction. Once the player's scoring record contains fewer than two exceptional tournament scores, the Committee must cease overriding and rely on the normal calculation under 10-2.
          • Adjust the amount of the reduction. The Handicap Committee may decide that the player's full 10-3 reduction does not reflect their potential ability, but a reduction is still necessary. In this case, the Handicap Committee may modify the amount of the reduction and the player's Handicap Index as calculated by Section 10-2. For example, if the player's 10-3 calculation is a 10.0R, but the 10-2 calculation is 15.0, the Handicap Committee could change the player's reduced value to a value of 12.5M. This does not completely override the player's reduction.
          
             f. Reporting Requirement
          
            
              Authorized golf associations
             and handicap computation services must report any Handicap Index reductions under this procedure (Section 10-3b) to the golf club. If computational reports are provided to the authorized golf association, the handicap computation service must also report any Handicap Index reductions to the authorized golf association. When a Handicap Index is reduced under this section, it must be identified with the letter R (e.g., 12.3R).
          
            
              
            10-4. Course Handicap
          A player's Course Handicap is determined by multiplying a Handicap Index by the Slope Rating of the course played and then dividing by 113. (See Section 3-3.) The resulting figure is rounded off to the nearest whole number (.5 or more is rounded upward).
          
            
              
            10-5. Nine-Hole Handicaps-Handicap Index (N) 
          
             a. Nine-Hole Handicap Use and Identification
          A nine-hole handicap is a Handicap Index (N) if the club follows the USGA Handicap System. A nine-hole handicap, or Handicap Index (N), may be used in inter-club play against other players with nine-hole handicaps. If a competition requires a Handicap Index, a Handicap Index (N) may be doubled for 18-hole play. 
          A player with both a Handicap Index and a Handicap Index (N) should use the Handicap Index (N) in inter-club nine-hole competition and the Handicap Index in 18-hole competition. 
          A player with only a Handicap Index playing in a nine-hole competition halves the Handicap Index and rounds the decimal upward to the nearest tenth, then converts it to a Course Handicap using the nine-hole Slope Rating from the Course Handicap Table for the tees being played.
          
             b. Method of Computation
          
            
              Golf clubs
             compute a Handicap Index (N) by applying nine-hole adjusted gross scores to the USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating of the nine holes played to determine Handicap Differentials. 
          
            
              Note
            : Players with a Handicap Index (N) who play an 18-hole round, must post two nine-hole scores to their scoring record (N).
          
            
              Example: For a nine-hole adjusted gross score of 45 with a nine-hole USGA Course Rating of 36.2 and a Slope Rating of 121, the nine-hole Handicap Differential is (45 - 36.2) x 113 / 121 = 8.2. If the average of the best ten nine-hole Handicap Differentials is 8.9, then the Handicap Index (N) is 8.9 x .96 = 8.5. It is posted as "8.5N."
          
             c. Nine-hole Equitable Stroke Control
          See definition of Equitable Stroke Control.
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
          
            
          
          
            
              Example: A player with a nine-hole Course Handicap of 12 must adjust to a maximum score of 8 for any hole, regardless of par.
          
             d. Maximum Nine-Hole Handicap
          The maximum Handicap Index (N) is 18.2 for men and 20.2 for women. 
          
            
              Note
            : A maximum Handicap Index will convert to a Course Handicap that exceeds these numbers on golf courses with a Slope Rating greater than 113. 
          A player may have a local handicap above these limits, but it must be identified as a local handicap by the letters "NL" following the number on a handicap card or report (e.g., 24.5NL). (See handicap type.) When such a local handicap is used for inter-club play, the USGA recommends that it be reduced to the maximum Handicap Index (N) specified above.

          Section 11 HANDICAP CONTROLS
          Definitions
          Within each section, all defined terms are in italics and are listed alphabetically in Section 2 -  Definitions.
          Handicap controls, a series of checks and balances, ensure that a Handicap Index will accurately measure a player's potential ability. These handicap controls prevent scores that are not representative of a player's potential ability from distorting the player's Handicap Index. The following handicap controls are incorporated into the USGA Handicap System to produce a reliable and equitable Handicap Index.
          
            
              
            11-1. Golf Club Handicap Committee
          An essential element of the USGA Handicap System is the Handicap 
        Committee. Every golf club utilizing the USGA Handicap System must have a Handicap Committee to ensure the integrity of the USGA Handicap System. The Handicap Committee sees that scores are posted, all elements of the USGA Handicap System are followed, and the integrity of each Handicap Index issued is maintained.
          (See Section 8.)
          
            
              
            11-2. Peer Review
          See definition of peer review. 
          
            
              
            11-3. Worst 10 Handicap Differentials Disregarded
          A player's worst 10 of the last 20 Handicap Differentials are not used in computing the Handicap Index since these scores do not represent the player's potential ability. (See Section 10.)
          
            
              
            11-4. Fewer than 20 Scores
          A player who has posted fewer than 20 scores has a Handicap Index that 
        is based on a lower percentage of scores than the 50 percent ideally used (best 10 of the last 20). The accuracy and reliability of the USGA Handicap System improves as the number of acceptable scores approaches 20. A handicap based on 20 acceptable scores is more representative of a player's potential ability than one based on fewer than 20. (See Section 10.)
          
            
              
            11-5. Equitable Stroke Control

            11-6. Reduction of Handicap Index Based on Exceptional Tournament Scores
          An alternate calculation is used to determine the Handicap Index of a player who has two or more eligible tournament scores with tournament score differentials at least 3.0 better than the player's Handicap Index. (See Section 10-3.)
          
            
              
            11-7. Handicap Index Adjustment or Withdrawal
          The Handicap Committee is authorized to modify or withdraw a Handicap Index of a player who does not return all acceptable scores, or does not otherwise observe the spirit of the USGA Handicap System. The Handicap Committee has the authority to increase the Handicap Index of a player who, because of exceptional circumstances, has a Handicap Index that is too low. The Handicap Committee must review a Handicap Index that is modified, reduced, or withdrawn at each revision. (See Sections 8-4d, 8-4e, and 10-3e.)

            11-9. Ratings Issued by Authorized Golf Association
          All courses must be rated in accordance with USGA approved procedures by a course rating team representing an authorized golf association. Each Handicap Index is determined on the same basis if every USGA Course Rating is uniform.
          
            
              
            11-10. Meeting Licensing Requirements
          Only a golf club or authorized golf association that issues and maintains each Handicap Index in full accordance with the USGA Handicap System, as described in the USGA Handicap System manual, and is licensed by the USGA for this purpose, may use the term Handicap Index and identify it as such on handicap cards or elsewhere. A golf club and golf association must obtain written authorization from the USGA in order to use the USGA's marks and to issue a Handicap Index.

            12-1. Starting Point: Permanent Markers
          Accurate permanent marker placement is imperative in the rating process. Permanent markers are to reflect an average placement of the movable tee markers over time. Incorrectly placed markers will make it difficult for the golf course staff to set up the course each day, keeping the effective course difficulty constant and in line with the ratings issued.
          Permanent marker placement is more likely to have a greater impact on ratings than green speed, height of rough and other course maintenance practices. Courses and clubs should pay special attention to this issue and are encouraged to consult the authorized golf associations in the area for assistance in determining accurate placement.
          When a single tee pad is designated for one set of tees, placement of the permanent marker at a point opposite the middle of the teeing area is appropriate. This maximizes the ability of the golf course to use the entire teeing area and gives the best chance of reflecting an average of movable marker placement over time.
          When more than one set of tees uses a single tee pad, consider the percentage of a club's existing or anticipated play from each set of tees when determining permanent marker placement. Allocate the percentage of play to the teeing area and place each permanent marker at a point opposite the mid-point of each of the allocated areas. As an example, a forty-yard teeing area is to be shared by three sets of tees. The club determines that 25% of play will be from the forward tees, 50% from the middle tees, and 25% from the back tees. Allocation would then have the first 10 yards of the teeing area dedicated to the forward tees, the middle 20 yards to the middle tees and the final 10 yards to the back tee. The permanent marker placement would be at the mid-point of each of these three areas.
          On a nine-hole course, if separate tees or tee markers are used for each nine of an 18-hole round, separate measurements and permanent yardage markers must be established for each nine. The yardage markers (and their respective tee markers) for each nine may be uniquely identifiable.
          
            
              
            12-2. Measuring 
          
             a. How To Measure
          Each hole must be measured horizontally (air line) by an electronic measuring device (EMD), surveying instruments, or a global positioning system (GPS) from the permanent yardage marker for every teeing area on the golf course to the center of the green. Any trained individual may perform course measurement, subject to review by the authorized golf association that issues the USGA Course Rating to the golf club. Yardages on the scorecard should accurately reflect this measurement. Accurate hole measurements to the nearest yard are very important.
          A hole with a dogleg must be measured on a straight line from the tee to the center of the fairway at the bend. If the pivot point is not easily discernible, select a pivot point that is approximately 250 (men) or 210 (women) yards from the set of tees played by the majority of golfers. The measurement must continue from that point on a straight line to the center of the green or to the next pivot point if applicable.
          
             b. Tee Markers; Posting of Ratings
          The tee markers used to designate the teeing ground (see "The Rules of Golf," Definitions) need to be consistent in color or design for each hole and distinguishable from other tee markers.  The actual color, design, or other method for identifying a particular set of tee markers is up to the Committee in charge of the course in consultation with the 
Handicap Committee.  
Course Handicap Tables (see Section
3-3), scorecards, and signage where scores are posted should use the same terminology in referring to the various tees.  This material should include the 
 USGA Course Rating and  Slope Rating for each set of tees to make it easy for players to convert a Handicap Index to a 
Course Handicap before play and then to post a score for handicap purposes, complete with Ratings, after play.
          A tee played by both men and women should have a separate
USGA Course Rating and 
Slope Rating.  If a set of tees has not been rated for the appropriate gender, the procedure for posting a score from a set of unrated tees may be used by both men and women when they play. (See Section 5-2g).
          Nine-hole Rating should be displayed by the golf club to assist players who are returning nine-hole scores for handicap purposes.  This also applies for a combination on nines.  Using a combination of tees throughout the round must be determined and published prior to the start of the round and is a matter for the Committee in charge of the competition to determine in consultation with the
Handicap Committee.
           
          
             
           
           
          
             
           
          Where tees generally used by one gender are also used by the other, there should be a USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating for men and for women from those tees so that all players may post their scores accurately for handicap purposes. The procedure for posting a score from a set of unrated tees may be used by both men and women when they play a set of tees that has not been rated for the appropriate gender. (See Section 5-2g.)
          Ratings for combinations of nine holes from each set of tee markers should be posted to assist players returning 18-hole scores made by combining nine-hole scores.

             a. Scratch Golfer
          See definition of scratch golfer.
          
             b. Yardage Rating
          Yardage rating is the evaluation of the playing difficulty of a course based on effective playing length.
          
             c. Obstacle Factors
          Obstacle factors are hazards, natural features, vegetation, and playing conditions found on the golf course that make play harder or easier than a standard course with the same effective playing length.
          
             d. Effective Playing Length
          Effective playing length is the measured length of the golf course adjusted by factors such as unusual roll, elevation changes, dogleg/forced lay up, prevailing wind, and altitude above sea level that make the course play longer or shorter than its measured length. For example, when forced lay ups result in a course playing effectively longer for the scratch golfer, the rating team modifies the yardage rating upward to arrive at the USGA Course Rating.
          
             e. USGA Course Rating
          See definition of USGA Course Rating.
          Courses are rated by authorized golf associations, not by individual clubs. (See Section 14.)
          
            
              Note
            : Yardage rating and USGA Course Rating are not to be confused with par. Par is not an accurate measure of the playing difficulty of a golf course. It is possible for two golf courses to have the same par, but differ greatly in USGA Course Rating and yardage rating.

            13-2. Conditions for Rating
          
             a. Placement of Tee Markers and Holes
          On the day a course is to be rated, the club is requested to do the following:
          (i) Place tee markers opposite the permanent yardage markers from which measurements were made (See Section 12); 
          (ii) Cut average hole locations; 
          (iii) Set up the course and maintain conditions for normal scoring difficulty. 
          
             b. In-Season Playing Conditions
          The USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating must reflect conditions normal for the season(s) when the most rounds are played.
          
             c. The Rules of Golf
          The USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating are based on the assumption that players observe and courses are marked under the Rules of Golf. Any local rules must conform with the spirit of the Rules of Golf and USGA policy. (See Section 7.)
          
            
              
            13-3. Course Rating Procedures
          
             a. Components
          An authorized golf association, through the following components, determines the USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating:
          (i) Effective playing length is obtained from official measurements of the course and an evaluation of the factors that cause the course to play significantly longer or shorter than its measured length. (Section 13-1d.) Yardage must be measured accurately. An error of only 22 yards in overall length will change the USGA Course Rating by 0.1 of a stroke for men. An error of only 18 yards will change the USGA Course Rating by 0.1 of a stroke for women. 
          (ii) Yardage ratings for both the scratch golfer and bogey golfer are determined by applying the effective playing length to the appropriate yardage rating formulas. (Sections 13-1d and 13-3d.) 
          (iii) USGA Course Rating is the scratch yardage rating of a course modified by the obstacle factors as they affect the scratch golfer. (See Definitions.) 
          (iv) Bogey Rating is the bogey yardage rating of a course modified by the obstacle factors as they affect the bogey golfer. (See Definitions.) 
          (v) Slope Rating is the difference between the Bogey Rating and the USGA Course Rating multiplied by 5.381 for men and 4.24 for women. (See Definitions and 13-3f.) 
          
             b. Effective Playing Length
          On each hole, the rating team evaluates four factors that affect the playing length: roll, elevation, dogleg/forced lay up and prevailing wind. The effect of these factors, plus the altitude above sea level of the course as a whole, is converted to yardage that is added to or subtracted from the measured length to yield effective playing length. Effective playing length is then applied to the yardage rating formulas to produce scratch and bogey yardage ratings.
          
            (i) Roll
            
            Unirrigated, thin fairways and downhill landing areas result in the ball rolling farther than the normal 20 yards. Irrigated, lush fairways and uphill landing areas result in the ball rolling less than 20 yards. 
          
            (ii) Elevation
            Holes that are uphill from tee to green play longer than those that are downhill from tee to green. 
          
            (iii) Dogleg/Forced Lay up
            Holes in which the fairway bends short of the normal landing area force the player to hit less than a full tee shot. The same is true on holes where an obstacle, such as a water hazard, is situated in the landing area. 
          
            (iv) Prevailing Wind
            
            The force and direction of the prevailing wind can affect the playing difficulty of the golf course. 
          
            (v) Altitude Above Sea Level
            
            The yardage rating of a course at an altitude at or above 2,000 feet is adjusted downward. The ball will carry a greater distance at high altitudes. 
          
             c. Obstacle Factors
          The rating team separately evaluates 10 obstacle factors on a scale of 0 through 10, for their effect on the play of the scratch golfer and bogey golfer on each hole. When the evaluation process has been completed, the numbers for each factor are totaled and multiplied by a relative weight factor. The total weighted obstacle values are applied to scratch and bogey formulas, and then are converted to strokes. These strokes, which may be positive or negative, are added to the yardage ratings to produce the USGA Course Rating and Bogey Rating. The obstacles are evaluated as follows:
          (i) Topography: the difficulty of stance in the fairway landing areas and any elevation change from the landing areas to the green; 
          (ii) Fairway: the effective width of the landing area, which can be reduced by a dogleg, trees, or fairway tilt; 
          (iii) Green Target: the size, firmness, shape, and slope of a green in relation to the length of the approach shot; 
          (iv) Recoverability and Rough: the existence of rough and other penalizing factors in the proximity of the landing area and around the green; 
          (v) Bunkers: the existence of bunkers in the proximity of the landing areas and around the green; 
          (vi) Out of Bounds/Extreme Rough: the existence of out of bounds in the proximity of the landing areas and around the green, or the existence of extreme unmown rough that is similar in effect to out of bounds; 
          (vii) Water Hazards: the existence of water hazards, particularly in the proximity of the landing areas and around the green; 
          (viii) Trees: the strategic location, size, height, and density of trees - along with the probability of recovering from the trees; 
          (ix) Green Surface: the contour and normal speed of the putting surface; 
          (x) Psychological: the mental effect on play created by the presence of a combination of difficult obstacles. 
          
             d. Yardage Rating Formulas
          Yardage ratings are obtained by using the following formulas:
          
            (i) Scratch Yardage Rating for Men
            Scratch Yardage Rating: (Scratch Effective Playing Length of Course / 220) + 40.9 Example: If the effective playing length of the course is 6,419 yards, the scratch yardage rating for men is calculated as follows:
          
            
              
                
                  Playing Length / 220:
                
                
                  6419 / 220 = 29.18 
                
              
              
                
                  Result + 40.9:
                
                
                  29.18 + 40.9 = 70.08 
                
              
              
                
                  Scratch Yardage Rating (rounded):
                
                
                  70.1 
                
              
            
          
          
          
            (ii) Bogey Yardage Rating for Men
            Bogey Yardage Rating: (Bogey Effective Playing Length of Course / 160) + 50.7 
          
            (iii) Scratch Yardage Rating for Women
            Scratch Yardage Rating: (Scratch Effective Playing Length of Course / 180) + 40.1 
          
            (iv) Bogey Yardage Rating for Women
            Bogey Yardage Rating: (Bogey Effective Playing Length of Course / 120) + 51.3

              Bogey Rating: 
            
            Bogey Yardage Rating + Bogey Obstacle Stroke Value 
          
          
             f. Slope Rating Formulas
          A Slope Rating is obtained by using the following formulas: 
          
            (i) Men
            
            
              Slope Rating
            : 5.381 x (Bogey Rating - USGA Course Rating) 
          
            (ii) Women
            
            
              Slope Rating
            : 4.24 x (Bogey Rating - USGA Course Rating) 
          The Slope Rating for a course of standard difficulty is 113. A course is given this Slope Rating when the difference between the Bogey Rating and USGA Course Rating is 21 strokes for men, or 26.65 strokes for women (21 multiplied by 5.381, equals 113; 26.65 multiplied by 4.24, equals 113).
          
            
              Note
            : Full details on course rating are contained in the books entitled "The USGA Course Rating System Guide" and "The USGA Course Rating System," which are available only to authorized golf associations.

          Definitions
          Within each section, all defined terms are in italics and are listed alphabetically in Section 2 - Definitions.
          
            
              
            14-1. Authorized Golf Associations to Rate Courses 
          All courses must be rated in accordance with USGA approved procedures by a course rating team representing an authorized golf association. A course rating review Committee established by the authorized golf association must evaluate each rating. If more than one authorized golf association covers the same territory, a joint rating team is suggested. 
          A club must never rate its own course.  If a club is unable to obtain Rating from an authorized golf association, it should immediately contact USGA Handicap Department for assistance. A golf club cannot use the USGA Handicap System until it has been issued a USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating by an authorized golf association. 
          
            
              
            14-2. Authorized Golf Associations to Re-rate Courses
          An authorized golf association must periodically review Ratings of courses and revise them as necessary. Newly constructed courses change rapidly in the first few years and must be re-rated within five years. An established course must be re-rated at least every 10 years, even if it has not been changed in any way. A course must no longer use its USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating if its ratings are more than 10 years old and scores recorded on that course may not be posted to a player's scoring record. Each course must contact an authorized golf association within its jurisdiction to schedule a re-rating.
          
            
              
            14-3. Personnel of Course Rating Team
          A course rating team should be composed of at least three trained and experienced individuals. A rating team may be assisted by a club representative, preferably a player with a low Handicap Index (or the club professional), who can inform the team of any unusual course conditions, including wind. Team members should have a practical knowledge of scratch golfers. Keeping the members of the team as permanent as possible helps to keep the ratings consistent.
          One member of the team must be designated by the authorized golf association as the team leader. The team leader must have attended a course rating seminar conducted by the USGA. The team evaluates each obstacle on each hole on a scale of 0 through 10 and should attempt to agree, within one number, on the evaluation for each obstacle. If an agreement is not reached, the opinion of the team leader should prevail. While rating a course, team members may hit shots to assist them in evaluating obstacles.
          It is recommended that the team play the course before or after the rating to substantiate the rating results. The team leader must submit completed rating forms to the authorized golf association for review by the course rating review Committee. This Committee may modify the results within specified limits, or it may direct a re-rating by another rating team. Once finalized by the course rating review Committee, the authorized golf association must issue these ratings to the club.
          
            
              
            14-4. Golf Association Records
          
             a. Information To Be Kept
          A file of each USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating must be kept by the authorized golf association for future reference. The checklist for the file should include: the scorecard, the names of the persons rating the course, the date on which the course was rated, the information regarding weather and other conditions on the day of rating, the fairway watering system, the types of grasses, the height of the rough, the official measurements of each hole, the names of persons who measured the golf course, and the presence of permanent yardage markers. 
          
             b. List of All Ratings
          The course rating review Committee must compile a list showing total yardage and the USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating for each course in its jurisdiction that has been rated. The Committee must periodically review this list for accuracy. 
          The course rating review Committee of each authorized golf association should alphabetize the list by course name and send it to every club in the area. This club listing should help members post their scores made on area courses. A copy must be submitted to the USGA Handicap Department annually by the authorized golf association.
          
            
              
            14-5. Modification of Courses
          
             a. Temporary Changes
          The Handicap Committee  must notify the  authorized golf association when temporary tees and/or greens are used.  The authorized golf association will decide whether or not scores made under those conditions are to be accepted for handicap purposes, and whether the USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating should be modified temporarily. The Handicap Committee has a responsibility to notify its members that when a hole is not played due to construction, the score for that hole must be par plus any handicap strokes to which the player is entitled. (See Section 4-2.) The procedure for issuing a temporary rating may be found in "The USGA Course Rating System."
          
             b. Permanent Changes
          The club must notify the authorized golf association when permanent changes are made to the course. Permanent changes to the course require the authorized golf association to review the current USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating and to determine whether a re-rating is necessary.

          Section 15 COURSE SET-UP
          Definitions
          Within each section, all defined terms are in italics and are listed alphabetically in Section 2 - Definitions.
          
            15-1. Keeping Course Difficulty Constant 
          
            A golf course is rated on its effective playing length and its playing difficulty under normal conditions. Each hole may be evaluated in determining the course setup from a distance standpoint in order to provide a fair test and to require a player to use most or all clubs during a round. If the length or normal playing difficulty changes materially, a 
            
              Handicap Index
            
             will be distorted. A difference of 22 yards for men or 18 yards for women will change the USGA course rating 0.1 of a stroke. The 
            
              Handicap Committee
            
             should seek the cooperation of the Green Committee in maintaining both length and normal playing difficulty at a constant and fair level. 
          
            15-2. Balancing Placement of Tees
          Placement of tee markers should be balanced so that the course's effective playing length is approximately the same from day to day. Adjustment may be made to allow for weather and turf conditions.
          The "teeing ground" is defined In "The Rules of Golf" as a rectangular area two club-lengths in depth, the front and the sides of which are defined by the outside limits of two tee markers. In view of this definition, the tee markers must always be at least two club-lengths forward of the back edge of the teeing ground.
          In the illustration below, the total area represents the usual teeing ground, and the heavy line in the center indicates the point of the permanent marker from which the hole was measured.
          
             
          Balance tee placement as follows:
          
             a. Normal conditions
          Place tee markers on odd-numbered holes on front half in area A (or B or C); on even numbered holes, place tee markers on back half of same-lettered area. When changing tee markers, place odd-hole markers on back half and even-hole markers on front half. In other words, alternate between the halves and rotate among lettered areas, always using areas of the same letter at the same time, except under conditions outlined below.
          
             b. Abnormal conditions
          Use rear areas for a fast course and forward areas for a slow course. For example, when the course is hard and fast, place front-half markers in A and back-half markers in C. When the course is soft and slow, place front-half markers in C and back-half markers in A.
          Under extreme conditions, all markers should be placed in the back half or the front half of all tees, depending upon what is necessary to try to achieve normal playing distance.
          The above recommendation should be followed for each set of tee markers.
          
            15-3. Hole Locations 
          Many factors affect the selection of hole locations. The first and most important is good judgment in deciding what will give fair results. Do not be tricky in selecting hole locations.
          Following are specific points:
          (i) Study the design of the hole as the architect intended it to be played. Know the length of the shot to the putting green and how it may be affected by the probable conditions for the day - that is, wind and other weather elements, condition of the turf from which the shot will be played, and holding quality of the putting green. 
          
            (ii) There must be enough putting green surface between the hole and the front and the sides of the green to accommodate the required shot. For example, if the hole requires a long iron or wood shot to the green, the hole may be located deeper in the green and farther from its sides than may be the case if the hole requires a short pitch shot. In any case, it is recommended that the hole be located at least four paces from any edge of the putting green. If a bunker is close to the edge, or if the ground slopes away from the edge, the distance should be greater, especially if the shot is more than a pitch.Consideration should be given to fair opportunity for recovery after a reasonably good shot that just misses the putting green.
          
            (iii) An area two to three feet in radius around the hole should be as nearly level as possible and of uniform grade. In no case should holes be located in tricky places or on sharp slopes where a ball can gather speed. A player above the hole should be able to stop the ball at the hole. 
          
            (iv) Consider the condition of nearby turf, especially taking care to avoid old hole plugs that have not completely healed. 
          
            (v) Holes should be cut as nearly on the vertical as possible, not plumb with the contour of the putting green. 
          
            (vi) There should be a balanced selection of hole locations for the entire course with respect to left, right, central, front, and back positions. For example, avoid too many left positions with the resulting premium on drawn or hooked shots. 
          
            (vii) For a competition played over several days, the course should be kept in balance daily as to degree of difficulty. In a stroke play competition, the first hole of the first round is as important as the last hole of the last round, so the course should not be set up appreciably more difficult for any round - balanced treatment is the aim. An old concept of making the course progressively harder round after round is fallacious. 
          Please consult the USGA publication "How to Conduct a Competition" for further reference.
          
            15-4. Preparing the Course
          The location of the tee markers should take into consideration both length and the various obstacles of the hole in order to provide a consistent and fair test that accurately reflects the USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating. 
          The various obstacles should be maintained in a manner that is similar to how they were rated, consistent with the principles of Section 15-1. 
          Please consult the USGA Publication "How to Conduct a Competition" for further reference.
          
            15-5. Marking the Course
          It is extremely important for the committee in charge of the competition or in charge of the course to ensure that the course has been properly and completely marked. It is difficult to play under the Rules of Golf on an unmarked golf course, and the USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating is based on the course being properly marked. If all boundaries, water hazards, and ground under repair have been properly marked, the committee will have few problems during the golf season.

      <title>Allocation of Handicap Strokes</title>
      <body>
          Section 17 ALLOCATION OF HANDICAP STROKES
          Definitions
          Within each section, all defined terms are in italics and are listed alphabetically in Section 2 - Definitions.
          
            17-1. Discretion of Committee 
          The basic principle of allocating handicap strokes is to equalize the abilities of players at different handicap levels.  A handicap stroke should be an equalizer rather than a winning stroke and should be available on a hole where it most likely will be need by the higher-handicapped player to obtain a half in singles or four-ball match play.  The following procedure is recommended but is not mandatory because it has minimal effect on handicaps (see Section 9-3).  Stroke allocations for men and women will usually be different because the need to equalize holes may vary from hole to hole  The 
Handicap Committee should use good judgment when reviewing the course hole-by-hole.  Difficulty in making 
par on a hole is not an effective indicator of the need for a stroke (see Section 17-5). 
          
             a. Basis of Allocation
          Allocate strokes based on play of the course from the tee markers used most often by the majority of club members.
          Allocate the first stroke to the hole on the first nine on which the higher-handicapped player most needs a stroke as an equalizer and the second stroke to the hole on the second nine on which the higher-handicapped player most needs a stroke as an equalizer. Alternate in this manner for the full 18 holes.
          Generally the longer the hole, the greater the need for the higher-handicapped player to receive a stroke.
          
             b. Distribution of Strokes
          
            (i) Odd Strokes/Even Strokes
            The USGA recommends that the odd-numbered strokes be assigned to the holes on the first nine and the even-numbered strokes to the holes on the second nine. This format equalizes, as nearly as possible, the distribution of handicap strokes over the entire 18 holes, and makes matches more equitable. In a case where the second nine is decidedly more difficult than the first nine, consideration should be given to allocating odd-numbered strokes to the second nine.
          
            (ii) Importance of Low Strokes
            The first handicap stroke should be allocated so that this stroke is most useful in matches between players of almost equal ability, such as matches involving players with a Course Handicap of 0 and 1, 10 and 11, or 29 and 30. In such matches, the first handicap stroke will be of the greatest importance as an equalizer to the player receiving the stroke. 
          In allocating the second handicap stroke, matches between players having a slightly greater difference in Course Handicap should be given the most consideration, such as matches involving players with a Course Handicap of 0 and 2, 10 and 12, or 29 and 31. This process should be continued until the first six strokes have been assigned.
          Without substantially deviating from the above principles, allocating low-numbered strokes to holes near the end of each nine should be avoided so that players receiving strokes will have the opportunity to use these strokes before either nine or 18-hole matches are decided. Lower-numbered strokes should not be allocated to the first and second holes of a course in the event that a hole-by-hole playoff is necessary.
          
            17-2. Allocation Based on Scores
          A mathematical method for allocating strokes, based on the principle that a handicap stroke should be an equalizer when an average or high-handicapped player plays a low-handicapped player, follows. This procedure may be applied separately with men's scores and women's scores.
          
            
              Note:
             When using all score methods, the Handicap Committee must give priority to the considerations of 17-1. See step (vii) below.
          
             a. Comparison Method
          (i) Collect about 200 hole-by-hole scores of a group of players (Group A) with a Course Handicap not exceeding 8 strokes for men and 14 strokes for women. A club having a limited number of low-handicapped players may use 200 scores from 25 percent of its players with the lowest Course Handicap. These scores should not be adjusted by Equitable Stroke Control. 
          (ii) Average the score for each hole for Group A, and average the Course Handicap of the players in Group A. 
          (iii) Collect about 200 hole-by-hole scores of a middle- to high-handicapped group of players (Group B). The average of the Course Handicap of each player in Group B should be 15 to 20 strokes higher than the average for each player in Group A. It is preferable for the Course Handicap of each player in Group B to range from 20 to 28 strokes for men and from 26 to 40 strokes for women. These scores should not be adjusted by Equitable Stroke Control. 
          (iv) Average the score for each hole for Group B and average the  Course Handicap of the players in Group B. 
          (v) Determine the difference in the average scores for each group on each hole by subtracting the average score of Group A from the average score of Group B. 
          (vi) List the holes in order from 1 through 18 with corresponding Group A average scores, Group B average scores and average score difference. Rank the holes with the hole having the highest average score difference first, and so on. The hole ranked number 1 is the hole on which the higher-handicapped player most needs a stroke. Continue the rankings through 18. 
          (vii) Modify the rankings of the holes, as based on average-score differences in accordance with Section 17-1b on distribution of strokes, and in accordance with Notes 1 and 2 below. Note 1: Occasionally, this method will result in one hole (Hole A) ranked ahead of another hole (Hole B). The Committee believes that Hole B should be ranked ahead of Hole A. The Committee may first determine the average range by subtracting the average-score difference of the 18th ranked hole from the average-score difference of the first ranked hole and divide the result by 18. If the difference between the average-score differences of Holes A and B is no greater than the average range, it would be appropriate for the Committee to rank Hole B ahead of Hole A.Note 2: A hole with a water hazard that presents a significant problem for high-handicapped players may be ranked as the first or second handicap-stroke hole based on its average-score difference. The Committee believes that this ranking is not justified when players of comparable ability are competing. In this instance, the Committee may downgrade the ranking of the hole. The Committee should always use good judgment in deciding what will give fair results.
          
             b. Regression Method
          An alternative method of allocating handicap strokes which uses all data points is to use linear regression. A minimum of 400 hole-by-hole scores is required from players representing the full range of Course Handicap. This is similar to the method in "Section 17-2a" of allocating handicap strokes using a large number of scores, but instead of comparing an average of scores among two distinctively-defined groups (Group A and B) with a large disparity in Course Handicap, the regression method uses all scores covering the whole Course Handicap range to allocate handicap strokes.
          
            Step 1: Collect a large number N (at least 400 (more is better)) hole-by-hole scores from the same tee and gender.
          
            Step 2: For each hole, take each of the hole-by-hole Course Handicap/score pairs and compute:
          1) The sum of all the Course Handicaps = S1 (this value is the same for all holes)
          2) The sum of all the scores = S2
          3) Compute square of each Course Handicap and then sum all these squared values = S3 (this value is also the same for all holes)
          4) Compute the product of Course Handicap multiplied by score for each handicap/score pair and then sum these values = S4
          5) Compute the difference factor (DF)
          DF = (N x S4) - (S1 x S2) divided by (N x S3) - (S12)
          
            Note: A plus Course Handicap must be entered as a negative (-) number for the regression calculation. 
          
            Step 3: Rank all holes based on this DF value. The greater the DF the greater the expected score difference between a low and a high handicapped golfer (i.e., the hole with largest DF is handicap-stroke hole number one). 
          
            Step 4: Assign the final allocation of handicap strokes based on Committee's discretion.
          
            17-3. Nine-Hole Courses
          These principles also apply to a nine-hole course played twice for a stipulated 18-hole round.
          
            17-4. 27-Hole Courses
          Strokes should be allocated to each nine holes separately -- 1 through 9. When two nines are combined for a handicap competition, the odd stroke-hole allocations should fall on the nine holes considered the first nine, and the even stroke-hole allocations should fall on the second nine. The example below shows the stroke-hole allocation for two nines combined for a competition.
          In mixed competition, the separate 9-hole stroke allocations for men and women should be converted to separate 18-hole stroke allocations. (Exception, Section 9-3a.)
          
            
          
          
            17-5. Four-Ball and Best-Ball Stroke Play; Stableford
          The Committee may develop a separate allocation table based on difficulty relative to par for four-ball stroke play, best-ball-of-four stroke play, and Stableford competitions. 
          
            In these forms of play, 
            
              golf clubs
            
             often have found that comparing hole difficulty in relationship to 
            
              par
            
             provides an effective basis for stroke allocation. If the 
            
              golf club
            
             has used the method based on scores as described in Section 17-2, the following method can be used for stroke play to determine the relative difficulty in relation to 
            
              par
            
             for the holes on a golf course. It averages the difficulty of holes of group A and B players to produce a representative difficulty in relation to 
            
              par
            
            of the holes:
          
          Total the group A and B average score for each hole;Subtract from this sum two times the par of each hole;Rank each hole result from largest to smallest;Do not modify the rankings of the holes.

      <body>
          
            Appendix A USGA Short Course Handicap Computation Procedure
          
          A Short Course Handicap is the USGA's service mark used to indicate a measurement of a player's potential ability on a Short Course (e.g., a golf course, as defined below, that is under 3,000 yards in length for 18 holes or 1,500 yards for nine holes). Potential ability is measured by a player's best scores and is expressed as a whole number. These scores are identified by calculating the Short Course Handicap differential for each score.
          
            A-1. Golf Clubs Permitted to Use Short Course Handicap Procedure 
          
          Golf clubs following procedures of the USGA Handicap System are allowed to issue a Short Course Handicap under the following conditions:
          (i) Short Course Handicaps may be issued by clubs with courses under 3,000 yards in length for 18 holes.  However, such courses may not be issued a USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating.
          
            (ii) A Short Course Handicap is not portable to any golf course other than the one where the Short Course Handicap was produced; 
           
          (iii) The golf club must be rated by an authorized golf association using the guidelines set forth in Section 18 of the "The USGA Course Rating System" (USGA Short Course Rating Procedure);
           
          
            Note: Such handicaps may not be termed a "Handicap Index" and must be identified by an "SL" to indicate that they are Short Course Handicaps.
           
          
            A-2. USGA Short Course Handicap Formula
          
          
            
            a. How To Determine Short Course Handicaps
          
          A Short Course Handicap differential is the difference between a player's adjusted gross score and the USGA Short Course Rating. Short Course Handicap differentials are expressed in strokes taken to one decimal place.
           
          
            Note: Short course scores are to be adjusted for all situations under adjusted gross scores (see definition of adjusted gross score) except Equitable Stroke Control is not applied.
           
          
            (i) Plus Differential
            When the adjusted gross score is higher than the USGA Short Course Rating, the Short Course Handicap differential is a positive number. The following is an example for determining a differential using a score made on a course with a USGA Short Course Rating of 51.2. 
          
            
              
                
                  Adjusted gross score:
                
                
                  64
                
              
              
                
                  USGA Short Course Rating:
                
                
                  
                    -51.2
                  
                
              
              
                
                  Short Course Handicap differential:
                
                
                  12.8
                
              
            
          
          
            
            (ii) Minus Differential
            When the adjusted gross score is lower than the USGA Short Course Rating, the Short Course Handicap differential is a negative number. The following is an example for determining a differential using a score made on a course with a USGA Short Course Rating of 51.2. 
          
            
              
                
                  Adjusted gross score:
                
                
                  50
                
              
              
                
                  USGA Short Course Rating:
                
                
                  
                    -51.2
                  
                
              
              
                
                  Short Course Handicap differential:
                
                
                  -1.2
                
              
            
          
           
          
            
            b. Computation of Short Course Handicap
          
          The Short Course Handicap formula is based on the best Short Course Handicap differentials in a player's scoring record. If a player's scoring record contains 20 or more scores, the best 10 Short Course Handicap differentials of the most recent 20 scores are used to calculate the Short Course Handicap. The percentage of scores used in the scoring record decreases as the number of scores in the scoring record decreases. If the scoring record contains 9 or 10 scores, only the best three scores (30 to 33 percent) in the scoring record will be used. The accuracy of a player's Short Course Handicap is proportional to the number of acceptable scores posted. A Short Course Handicap must not be issued to a player who has returned fewer than five acceptable scores. A Short Course Handicap is expressed as a whole number (e.g., 10SL).
          
            
              Example 1
            : The following is a sample scoring record of a player with 20 scores in the scoring record that shows how the Short Course Handicap is calculated by a golf club or authorized golf association.
          
            
            
          
          
            
              
                
                  Total of 10 lowest Short Course Handicap differentials:
                
                
                  89.4
                
              
              
                
                  Average (89.4 / 10):
                
                
                  8.94
                
              
              
                
                  Short Course Handicap (rounded):

              Example 2
            : The following procedure illustrates how to calculate a player's Short Course Handicap if the number of acceptable scores in the player's record is fewer than 20 (11 scores available).
          (i) Use the following table to determine the number of Short Course Handicap differentials to use based on the number of acceptable scores returned; 
          
            
          
          
            (ii) Determine Short Course Handicap differentials; (iii) Average the Short Course Handicap differential(s) to be used; (iv) Round fractions of .5 or greater upward 
          
            
              
                
                  Total of lowest 4 Short Course Handicap differentials: 
                
                
                  44.3
                
              
              
                
                  Average (44.3 / 4):

              *Note
            : A Short Course Handicap is expressed as a whole number, not a decimal number like a Handicap Index. A Short Course Handicap is not portable and not valid at any golf course other than the player's home golf club.

          Appendix B SAMPLE LETTER APPLYING Section 8-4c 
          [Club Stationery]
          [Date]
          Dear 
          After reviewing your scoring record, the Handicap Committee of [club name] has determined that your Handicap Index does not accurately reflect your potential playing ability. We have concluded that [your rapid improvement, your numerous away scores, your recent injury, your failure to post scores, your posting of erroneous scores] has produced a Handicap Index that is not accurate.
          In the interest of fair play, the Handicap Committee is going to modify your Handicap Index under Section 8-4c of "The USGA Handicap System." Your Handicap Index will become [e.g., 7.6M]. Before the adjustment becomes effective, you may appeal to the Handicap Committee either by letter or in person by [date]. If the Handicap Committee does not hear from you or determines that the reasons for modification are still valid, the modified Handicap Index will become effective on [date]. 
          The Handicap Committee will review this adjustment at each handicap revision date to determine if your Handicap Index should revert to the normal handicap formula computation by Section 10-2. In the meantime, continue to post all of your scores and observe all aspects of the USGA Handicap System.
          Sincerely,
          
             
          Handicap Chairperson

          Appendix C JUNIOR PAR
        
        Junior par is the adjustment of par to realistic levels for junior players of various ability levels. Junior par provides a realistic standard against which a junior can measure improvement until acquiring a game capable of being measured against par. A Handicap Index for juniors is calculated by the formula in Section 10. A Handicap Index is converted to a Course Handicap for the course being played.
        
          C-1. Establish Junior Playing Levels
        
        Using junior par, players are identified as beginner, intermediate, or advanced players. A beginner will have a Course Handicap of 41 or above; an intermediate will have a Course Handicap from 25 through 40; and an advanced junior player will have a Course Handicap under 25. (Course Handicap for juniors based on USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating is normally established from the forward tees.)
        The golf club can categorize the abilities of juniors who do not have a Handicap Index by other methods. For example, some golf clubs have their beginners play only three or six holes until they can achieve a target score. Then they move on to playing nine holes, and eventually 18 holes. The club might designate its three-hole or six-hole players as beginners and the nine-hole and 18-hole players as intermediates until they develop a Course Handicap of 24 or better.
        
          C-2. Establish Junior Par
        
        Junior par for any hole is based on the yardage of the hole measured from the forward tees and the ability of the junior player. The following tables show how junior par is calculated for girls and boys.

            Appendix D Sample letter explaining Section 3-5 and 9-3c
          
          (Club Stationary)
          (Date)
          Dear, 
          This letter is in regard to your recent question regarding what procedure to follow when players are competing against each other and are playing from different USGA Course Rating&amp;trade;.
          The USGA Handicap SystemTM is set up so each player converts a Handicap Index to a Course HandicapTM and plays with the Course Handicap as calculated. However, if players are competing against each other and a difference in USGA Course RatingTM exists, an additional adjustment must be made to the Course Handicap of the player playing from the higher-rated set of tees.
          When a difference in USGA Course Rating exists among competitors, their benchmark has changed and the difference must be accounted for in order for the competition to be equitable. (See example(s) under Section 3-5 in "The USGA Handicap System.")
          There are two options when applying this adjustment. The rounded difference in Course Rating can be either added to the higher-rated tee players or subtracted from the lower rated tee players. (See Decision 3-5/1 for further reference.)
          Please keep in mind that this adjustment is only applied when players are competing against each other. A Handicap Index is a number based on a standard calculation and not specific to any set of tees. A Course Handicap only gives a player the number of strokes needed to play down to the USGA Course Rating for a particular set of tees. 
          It is important to remember that a Handicap Index is just a mathematical representation of potential ability, and we need to make a conversion to the set of tees we play, and then an additional adjustment if we are competing against a player who is playing from a different set of tees, so that an equitable competition can be played. 
          Also, not applying Section 3-5 of "The USGA Handicap System" when players are competing from different tees would be waiving a Rule of Golf, and the Committee in charge of a competition does not have the authority to waive a Rule of Golf (see Decision 3-5/2).
          For more information, please refer to the brochure on players competing from different USGA Course Rating and the USGA position paper on this topic located on the USGA's Web site at: www.usga.org.
          Sincerely,

            The values in the table represent the probability of shooting a net differential* EQUAL TO OR BETTER THAN the range in the left column.
          *A net differential is the Handicap Differential for a particular score minus the player's Handicap Index.  This becomes a negative value when the differential for a score is lower than the player's Handicap Index. 
          
            
              Example:
             A player with a Handicap Index of 10.5 shoots a 74 from a set of tees with a USGA Course Rating of 70.2 and a Slope Rating of 126. 
          
            
              
                
                  (74 - 70.2) = 3.8 x 113 / 126
                
                
                   
                
                
                  = 3.4 Handicap Differential
                
              
              
                
                  3.4 - 10.5
                
                
                   
                
                
                  = - 7.1 Net Differential
                
              
            
          
          
            From the chart, the probability is 1 in 1,200 of this occurring.

      <body>
        Appendix F  USGA Handicap System Licensing Program for Clubs 
        Any group desiring to be a golf club must contact an authorized golf association in its area to begin the licensing process. (See the USGA Web site at www.usga.org for a listing of authorized golf associations or call  
          the USGA Handicap Department at (908) 234-2300). The group does not have to be a member club of the association. The authorized golf association must review the licensing application and confirm that the golf club is following the appropriate handicap revision schedule and  
          the season schedule.
        A "golf club" is an organization of at least ten individual members* that operates under bylaws with committees (especially a Handicap Committee) to supervise golf activities, provide peer review, and maintain the integrity of the USGA Handicap System (see Club Compliance Checklist, Section 8-2m and Decision 2/7). A golf club must be licensed by the USGA to utilize the USGA Handicap System. A club can obtain a license directly from the USGA or through its membership in an authorized golf association that is already licensed by the USGA and that has jurisdiction in the geographic area that includes the principal location of the golf club. 
        Members of a golf club must have a reasonable and regular opportunity to play golf with each other. They must be able to return scores  
        personally, and these scores must be readily available for inspection by others, including, but not limited to, fellow members and the club's Handicap Committee.
        A golf club is one of three (3) Types:
        Type 1. The members of a Type 1 club are located at a single specific golf course with a valid USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating where a majority of the club's events are played and where the club's scoring records reside; or
        Type 2. The members of a Type 2 club are affiliated, or known to one another, via a business, fraternal, ethnic, or social organization. The majority of the club members had an affiliation prior to organizing the club; or
        Type 3. The members of a Type 3 club had no prior affiliation and a majority of the recruiting and sign up of the membership is done by solicitation to the public (e.g., newspaper, Internet).
        *Note: For administrative reasons, some authorized golf associations may require a golf club to have more than the USGA minimum of ten members in order for the golf club to be a member of the authorized golf association. (See Section 2.)
        Any licensed golf club is subject to an audit by the USGA to ensure compliance. When a golf club is chosen for an audit, the authorized golf association in the area will be notified. A golf club to be audited should receive assistance from the authorized golf association that it initially contacted regarding the licensing process, regardless of whether the golf club is a member of the association. (See Appendix G.)

      <title>Appendix G</title>
      <body>
        
          Appendix G Golf Club Audit Procedure 
        
        The USGA has initiated an audit program for golf clubs to ensure the integrity of the USGA Handicap System. All licensed golf clubs are subject to being audited by the USGA, regardless of whether there is a compliance item in question.
        Any licensed golf club that is reported to the USGA in writing as having a potential compliance issue is immediately subject to an audit.
        If an audited golf club does not satisfy the audit process, the USGA will send a letter stating the non-conforming issues. A time limit will be set for the club to cure its deficiencies or run the risk of being dropped from the authorized golf club list located at www.usga.org, including losing its ability to utilize the USGA Handicap System. 
        
          Enforcement Procedure
        
        The USGA will ask an authorized golf association in the area to contact the club about compliance. If neither that association nor the USGA is able to persuade the golf club to comply, the USGA will advise the club in writing that the club may not utilize the USGA Handicap System and may not use USGA trademarks in any manner.
        The club will be withdrawn from the list of golf clubs authorized to utilize the USGA Handicap System. The USGA reserves the right to inform others that the club's right to utilize the USGA Handicap System has been withdrawn. 
        
          Appeal Process
        
        If a golf club is dissatisfied with the initial decision, it may appeal to the USGA Handicap Committee by sending written notice to the USGA within 30 days after being notified of the loss of its ability to utilize the USGA Handicap System. If the golf club elects to appeal, its representative must be given reasonable notice of that Committee's next meeting at which the matter is to be heard, and will be entitled to present its case. The USGA Handicap Committee will issue a final decision on the matter using all information provided by the golf club together with the findings and recommendations of the staff. 
        
          Reinstatement Policy and Procedure
        
        A golf club that has lost the privilege of utilizing the USGA Handicap System will be required to apply for reinstatement of that privilege and resubmit an application for a license agreement. Upon receipt of the completed application, the USGA will provide a list of requirements that need to be satisfied in order for the application to be considered. Upon the golf club satisfying the USGA that these requirements have been met, the USGA will notify the golf club and all parties that were previously notified of the club's non-compliance that the club is again eligible to utilize the USGA Handicap System. However, the reinstated golf club is subject to the audit process during each of the next two years.

      <title>Appendix H</title>
      <body>
        
          Appendix H Method for Determining Most Improved Player
        
        The USGA recommended method for determining a club's most improved player at the end of a season or year is as follows:
        Add 12* to the player's Handicap Index at the start of the season. This is value A. Add 12 to the player's Handicap Index at the end of the season. This is value B.
        Divide value A by value B, calculating to three decimal places. This is the improvement factor. The player with the highest improvement factor should receive the most improved player award.
        
          
            Example
          
          :
        
        
          
            
              Starting Handicap Index:
            
             
            
              22.6 
            
          
          
            
              Ending Handicap Index:
            
             
            
              17.4
            
          
          
            
              Value A:
            
             
            
              22.6 + 12 = 34.6 
            
          
          
            
              Value B:
            
             
            
              17.4 + 12 = 29.4 
            
          
          
            
              A / B:
            
             
            
              34.6 / 29.4 = 1.177 
            
          
          
            
              Improvement Factor:
            
             
            
              1.177 
            
          
        
         
        Continue this process for every player who improved during the year. The player with the highest improvement factor is the most improved player.
        Note: Add 6* instead of 12 in the case of a nine-hole Handicap Index (N).
        *The numbers 6 and 12 have been determined by the USGA as equitable in gauging the improvement of players encompassing the entire spectrum of handicaps. For example, it is relatively the same improvement factor to go from a 20.0 to a 10.0 Handicap Index (improvement factor of 1.454) as it is to go from a 5.0 to a scratch, or zero Handicap Index (improvement factor of 1.416), yet the change in Handicap Index is "10" (20  -  10) versus "5" (5  -  0) strokes. The numbers of 6 and 12 take into consideration the level of a player's improvement rather than the net change in Handicap Index.

            Section 1 PURPOSE, AUTHORIZATION, AND LICENSING
            
              1-1/1. Player Establishes One Handicap Index Playing Right-Handed and Another Handicap Index Playing Left-Handed
            
              Q: A player has a Handicap Index of 2.6 playing right-handed and a Handicap Index of 29.3 playing left-handed. Is this permissible?
            
              A: No. A Handicap Index is based on the best play for every round. Accordingly, the Handicap Index of 29.3 must be withdrawn.
             
            
              1-1/2. Player Discontinues Playing Left-Handed and Begins Playing Right-Handed
            
              Q: A player discontinues playing left-handed and begins to play right-handed. What is the status of the player's Handicap Index based on scores made playing left-handed?
            
              A: The Handicap Index established by the player when playing left-handed is invalid. The player is in effect beginning golf anew and is required to establish a new Handicap Index based on scores made when playing right-handed.
            
              1-2/1. Club's Policies Not in Compliance With the USGA Handicap System
            
              Q: The USGA requires that a club's policies comply with "The Rules of Golf" and the USGA Handicap System in order to utilize the USGA Handicap System. If the USGA is notified in writing that a club is not complying, what action will the USGA take?
            
              A: If notified in writing, the USGA will request the authorized golf association in the area to contact the club directly about policies not in compliance. If the golf club is a member club of the authorized golf association, the USGA will request that association to contact the club directly. If the golf club is not a member club of the authorized golf association, the USGA will contact the club directly, in accordance with the license agreement between the golf club and the USGA. In any case, the authorized golf association will be kept informed.
            If neither the authorized golf association nor the USGA is able to persuade the club to comply, the USGA will advise the club in writing that, without compliance, the club may not issue a Handicap Index, may not use any part of the USGA Handicap System, and may not use USGA trademarks in any manner. If a club refuses to comply, the USGA will inform other USGA member clubs and clubs licensed to issue a Handicap Index in the region that the club's privilege to issue a Handicap Index has been withdrawn. 
            
              1-2/2. Golf Club not Licensed by USGA. 
            
              Q: A golf club is not a member club of an authorized golf association and has not been licensed by the USGA to utilize the USGA Handicap System. Is such a club eligible to issue a Handicap Index?  
            
              A: No. All clubs must be licensed by the USGA to utilize the USGA Handicap System, either directly by the USGA or through an authorized golf association.

              2/1. Clarification of Term "Golf Club"
            
              Q: Membership in a golf organization is open to any player living within a large geographic area. In general, the members play at different golf facilities within the area, and do not normally play golf with one another. Is this organization a golf club within the meaning of the term in Section 2?
            
              A: No. Section 2 states that in order for an organization to be considered a golf club, "members must have a reasonable and regular opportunity to play golf with each other." Also, the members of a golf club who are issued a Handicap Index must be from a small defined geographic area. For example: the residence or business address of each member of the golf club must generally be within approximately a 50 mile radius for Type 3 golf clubs (75 miles for Type 2 golf clubs) of the principal location of the golf club. (Applies to Type 2 and Type 3 only.) (REVISED)
            
              [2/2. Reserved] 
            
              [2/3. Reserved] 
            
              2/4. Club Members at a Driving Range Issued Handicap Index
            
              Q: May a driving range utilize the USGA Handicap System?
            
              A: Yes. Hitting golf balls at the same driving range does not provide the opportunity to play golf together as required in the definition of a golf club. However, nothing prevents a driving range from being the principal location of a golf club. As long as its members have a reasonable and regular opportunity to play golf with each other, peer review is being performed, and all items on the Club Compliance Checklist are being met, this club is satisfying its requirements and is eligible to be licensed to issue a Handicap Index. (See Decision 2/7.) 
            
              2/5. Golf Club Composed of Company Employees
            
              Q: A group of 52 employees from a company formed a golf club. The members work at the same office and play in a weekly league after work. The club has bylaws based on the USGA's sample bylaws with officers and meetings. A Handicap Committee has been formed and handicap reports are posted on a bulletin board for all to see. Scores are personally posted by members and reviewed by the Handicap Committee. All other requirements of the USGA Handicap System are followed. Is this group eligible to be licensed to utilize the USGA Handicap System?
            
              A: Yes. Peer review standards are being met as members have a reasonable and regular opportunity to play golf with each other, as well as to review scores posted, and the Handicap Committee has the reasonable opportunity to satisfy the peer review oversight requirements set forth in Section 8.
            
              2/6. Organization Recruiting Members through Advertisement
            
              Q: An organization places an advertisement in a public newspaper or on a Web site inviting players to join a group that it calls a golf club. The player is asked to sign up, at the Web site or by mail, and pay via the Web site or by mail. Members are invited to play in tournaments held frequently and handicap reports and scoring records are displayed on a Web site or mailed to each member on revision dates. Members generally post scores via the Internet. In return, the player will receive a Handicap Index. Can this organization meet the USGA Handicap System definition of a golf club and utilize the USGA Handicap System?
            
              A: Yes. See the definition of a golf club (Section 2), specifically Type 3. It is understood that Type 3 clubs organize by advertising for members. But, in addition all portions of the golf club definition must be met, the golf club must follow all aspects of the Club Compliance Checklist (see Section 8-2m), and the club must comply with all sections of the USGA Handicap System, including the clarifications listed in Decision 2/7. 
            
              2/6.5. Effect of Advertising on Golf Club Category 
            
              Q: Can a golf club that currently exists as a Type 1 or Type 2 club advertise for the purposes of adding unaffiliated players? If so, could this action cause the club to become a Type 3 golf club?
            
              A: Nothing prohibits any golf club from advertising for members. As long as only a relatively small minority of the club members join because of advertising, the club Type would not be affected. 
            
              2/6.7. Third Party Involvement in Membership Process
            
              Q: A group of golf clubs gets together and advertises membership openings. A third party becomes involved and signs up individuals to become members of these clubs. Is this acceptable?
            
              A: Each golf club's bylaws may provide how new members are approved. A third party may inform a player about the possibility of becoming a member of a particular golf club, but each individual player must complete the membership application process and be approved by the club. A proposed candidate for membership may not become a member of a club until these requirements are met. 
            
              2/7. Clarification of Compliance/License Issues for Golf Club Categories Described in the Golf Club Definition 
            "Principal Location" (applies to Type 2 and Type 3 only)
            The principal location of a golf club must be the physical address in the city or town which the club first identified in its application for a license to utilize the USGA Handicap System. So long as the golf club is in existence, the principal location must not be changed without the prior written consent of the authorized golf association of which the golf club is a member, or if the club is not a member of a golf association, of the USGA. Members of a golf club who are issued a Handicap Index must be from a small-defined geographic area, e.g., the residence or business address of each member of a Type 3 golf club generally must be within approximately a 50 mile radius of the principal location of the golf club. For a Type 2 golf club, members generally must be within approximately a 75 mile radius of the principal location of the golf club.
            "Identification" (applies to Type 3 only)
            Each individual must provide proof of identification and residence to the golf club in order to be a member of the club. 
            "Playing Requirements and Club Size" (applies to Type 3 only)
            The USGA will consider the playing requirement met if each member returns at least three scores played with other club members during the season, and at least one of those rounds is played in a club-sponsored event. Anyone not meeting this minimum requirement should be dropped from the handicap roster.
            A golf club's size is limited: If membership in a club exceeds the number of available tee times offered in club-sponsored events, the playing requirements are not being met. For example, if a club has 200 members and conducts only eight organized events with a maximum of 15 players each, not all members will have played in a club sponsored event (8 x 15 = 120, not 200 or greater).
            "Group Cohesion/Activities" (applies to all Types)
            In order to be able to utilize the USGA Handicap System, the golf club must have group cohesion. Group activities should go beyond playing in tournaments. There should be a group orientation policy and other functions, such as group meetings, award banquets and the like.
            "Contact Information" (applies to all Types)
            Contact information about each member of the golf club must be made readily available to all members. (REVISED)
            
              2/7.5. Club-Sponsored Event 
            
              Q: What constitutes a club-sponsored event, as referenced in the playing requirements portion of Decision 2/7? 
            
              A: A club-sponsored event is one that is organized and conducted by the golf club, the majority of participants are members of the club, and its contestants are playing the same golf course during a single round. The format of the competition must result in an acceptable score for handicap purposes and its conduct must be under the principles of the Rules of Golf. Providing club-sponsored events allows for interaction among members including some that may not normally play golf with one another, which increases the likelihood of peer review taking place. A club with 150 members that conducts a four-person event is deemed not to be fulfilling the intent of the club-sponsored event requirement.
            
              2/8. Clarification of Reasonable and Regular Opportunity to Play Golf with Each Other 
            
              Q: Parts of the definitions of a Golf Club and Peer Review state, providing a reasonable and regular opportunity for members of a golf club to play golf with each other.  Would this requirement be satisfied by being on the same golf course, but not together within groups? 
            
              A: No. In order to gain an understanding of a player's potential ability and to form a reasonable basis for supporting or disputing a score that has been posted, a player needs to have played in the group with a fellow member. Merely being on the same golf course on the same day is not considered adequate for peer review to take place, as stated in the definitions of "peer review" and "golf club."

            Section 3 THE PLAYER
            
              3-2/1. Player has Handicap Index (N) and Wishes to Participate in 
        18-Hole Competition
            
              Q: A player with a Handicap Index (N) (see Section 10-5) wishes to compete in an 18-hole competition. The player does not have an 18-hole Handicap Index. How may the player calculate an 18-hole handicap? 
            
              A: If a player has a Handicap Index (N), the player should double the Handicap Index (N) for 18-hole play. It may be noted that the Handicap Index (N) is not as accurate as an 18-hole Handicap Index; it is based on half as many hole scores, and the player will generally receive one or two fewer strokes than with an 18-hole Handicap Index.
            
              3-2/2. Handicap to Use if Player Has Both an 18-Hole Handicap Index and Handicap Index (N)
            
              Q: A player has both an 18-hole Handicap Index and a Handicap Index (N). If the player's Handicap Index (N) were doubled, it would not be equal to the player's 18-hole Handicap Index. Which Handicap Index may the player use in a competition?
            
              A: The 18-hole Handicap Index should be used for 18-hole play and the Handicap Index (N) should be used for 9-hole play.
            
              3-5/1. Adjusting for the Difference in USGA Course Rating between Two Sets of Tees when Most of the Field is Playing from the Higher-rated Set of Tees
            
              Q: When adjusting for the difference in USGA Course Rating between two sets of tees, a player playing from the higher-rated set of tees must add the difference in USGA Course Rating to the player's Course Handicap. In a competition with a field of 100 players, in which 88 are playing the back tees and 12 are playing the forward tees, instead of adding the difference in USGA Course Rating to the Course Handicap of each of the 88 players, could the Committee subtract it from the Course Handicap of the 12 players playing the lower-rated set of tees?
            
              A: Yes. The Committee may subtract the difference in rating in such cases since the overall effect will be the same.
            
              3-5/2. May a Golf Club Choose Not to Follow Section 3-5 of the USGA Handicap System
            
              Q: May golf clubs choose not to follow Section 3-5 of "The USGA Handicap System" manual if the club's groups are competing from different tees?
            
              A: No. Not applying Section 3-5 of The "USGA Handicap System" when players are competing from different tees would be waiving a Rule of Golf, and the Committee in charge of a competition does not have the authority to waive a Rule of Golf. 
            
              3-6/1. Player in Match Uses Established Handicap but Handicap is Too High Due to Player's Failure to Observe Provision of the USGA Handicap System 
            
              Q: Player A's Course Handicap is 23 and Player B's Course Handicap is 31. A and B compete in a match and, based on the handicap allowance from Section 9-4a(i), B receives 8 strokes, the difference between 31 and 23. B wins the match, 1 up. A questions B's handicap; B admits to not adjusting hole scores under the Equitable Stroke Control provision of the USGA Handicap System. It is determined that if B had adjusted hole scores using ESC, Course Handicap would be 29 strokes. The Committee disqualifies B under Rule 6-2a. Was the Committee correct? 
            
              A: Rule 6-2a of "The Rules of Golf," acknowledges that: "Before starting a match in a handicap competition, the players should determine from one another their respective handicaps. If a player begins the match having declared a higher handicap which would affect the number of strokes given or received, the player is disqualified; otherwise, the player plays off the declared handicap." 
            B's Course Handicap, although incorrect due to the player's failure to apply Equitable Stroke Control, was 31. Accordingly, B was not in breach of Rule 6-2a and the match should have stood as played. 
            
              As it is impractical for a Committee conducting a competition to determine whether a player has correctly recorded each score, turned in all scores, etc., for handicap purposes, the Rules of Golf assume that the player has done so. The solution to a situation such as this is for the Handicap Committee to take appropriate action against B under Section 8-4c of the USGA Handicap System manual because of the player's failure to apply Equitable Stroke Control to the scores the player returned for handicap purposes.

            Section 4 ADJUSTING HOLE SCORES
            
              4-1/1. Explanation of "Most Likely Score" for Holes Not Completed
            
              Q: Section 4, adjusting hole scores, says that a player who starts but does not complete a hole records for handicap purposes the "most likely score." This score must not exceed the player's maximum number under Equitable Stroke Control. Clarify the meaning of most likely score.
            
              A: Most likely score is a judgment that each player must make based on the player's own game. It consists of the number of strokes already taken plus, in the player's best judgment, the number of strokes needed to complete the hole from that position more than half the time. The player must evaluate each situation based on what the player can reasonably expect to score. 
            Finally, the player compares the most likely score to the maximum permitted under Equitable Stroke Control and enters the lower of the two. For example, if most likely score is 8 but the applicable ESC maximum is 7, the player enters a score, for handicap purposes, of X-7.
            
              4-2/1. Explaining the Phrase "Principles of the Rules of Golf" in Accordance with "The USGA Handicap System" Manual 
            
              Q: What is meant by the phrase "in accordance with the principles of the Rules of Golf" in "The USGA Handicap System" manual? 
            
              A: The phrase "in accordance with the principles of the Rules of Golf " refers to situations where the player has played a hole in such a manner that the score would be sufficiently accurate to be used for handicap computation purposes. Occasionally, holes are not played strictly in accordance with the Rules of Golf. Thus, flexibility has been provided in the USGA Handicap System for a score to remain acceptable for handicap posting purposes in certain situations. This policy better ascertains the player's potential ability by attempting to capture more scores for handicap purposes than just those made in accordance with the Rules of Golf. For example, a player starting but not finishing a hole in stroke play (e.g., picking up before holing out) records the "most likely score" for handicap purposes (see Section 4-1).
            If a player uses a distance (only) measuring device or plays a round under preferred lies, regardless of the Local Rule established, the score remains acceptable for handicap purposes. (See Decision 5-1e/2 and Section 7.) This policy also includes situations that are generally out of the player's control, such as incorrectly installed hole liners or an incorrectly marked golf course. (See Section 15-5.)

            Section 5 SCORES
            
              5-1a/1. Use of Scores Made by Playing Nine Random Holes of 18-Hole Course Twice
            
              Q: When the weather is unpredictable, many of our members play holes 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18, all of which are relatively near the clubhouse. They then play the same holes again. May such scores be returned for handicap purposes?
            
              A: Yes. Since this is common practice, the club may obtain, from its authorized golf association, a USGA Course Rating and Slope Rating for the course when played in this manner so Handicap Differentials can be determined.
            
              5-1a/2. Score Made When Playing Alone
            
              Q: If a player plays alone, should the score be returned for handicap purposes?
            
              A: Yes, provided the round is played in accordance with the Rules of Golf.
            
              5-1a/3. Returning Scores for Handicap Purposes While Playing on Temporary Greens or Tees
            
              Q: May a club accept scores for handicap purposes if temporary greens or tees are being used?
            
              A: Yes. If the Rules of Golf can be followed during the reconstruction period, scores should be posted. The club must contact its authorized golf association for advice regarding its specific situation. If a temporary green (not an alternate permanent green) is played, the recommendation of the authorized golf association may be for the club to advise players to post par plus any handicap strokes the player is entitled to receive on that hole. (See Section 4-2.) (Revised)
            
              5-1a/4. Acceptability of Scores Made While Taking Playing Lessons
            
              Q: May a player post a score made while taking a playing lesson?
            
              A: No. Scores made when a player is receiving instruction are not made in accordance with the Rules of Golf - see Rule 8-1 of "The Rules of Golf" and may not be used in computing a Handicap Index.
            
              5-1a/5. Status of Scores Made when Two Balls Played Throughout Round
            
              Q: A player frequently plays alone and plays two balls throughout the round. May the player return the score made with each ball for handicap purposes?
            
              A: No. The player may not return the score made with either ball, as such scores are not made in accordance with the Rules of Golf - see Rule 7-2 of "The Rules of Golf."
            
              5-1b/1. Club Will Not Accept Away Scores
            
              Q: May a club decline to accept away scores for handicap purposes?
            
              A: No. A basic premise of the USGA Handicap System is that a player will post every acceptable round for peer review.
            
              5-1c/1. Status of Scores Made When Match Play and Stroke Play Combined
            
              Q: Two players competed in a match in the club championship and at the same time competed in a stroke play competition. Such practice is prohibited under Rule 33-1 of the Rules of Golf. May players return their scores for handicap purposes?
            
              A: The stroke play score is an acceptable score for handicap purposes.
            
              5-1e/1. Returning Scores Made at Par-3 Golf Courses
            
              Q: Why is it not permissible for a Handicap Index to be computed from scores made on par-3 courses which are less than 3,000 yards in length?
            
              A: Such courses do not normally require the use of a full set of clubs. It would not be equitable to handicap players on such short courses on the same basis as players on standard courses. A score on such a course is analogous to a score made in a competition that limits types of clubs. Such scores are not acceptable.
            However, scores made on par-3 courses may be used to produce equitable handicaps for use at such courses only. Please follow the policy in Appendix A.
            
              5-1e/2. Scores Made Using a Distance-Measuring Device or Multi-Functional Device
            
              Q: Are scores made using information generated from a Distance-Measuring Device or Multi-Functional Device acceptable for handicap purposes?
            
              A: In certain situations, yes. If a player uses a Distance-Measuring Device to measure distance, or uses a Multi-Functional Device to access weather reports provided by weather stations through an application or Internet browser, the player is not participating in the specific act of gauging or measuring variable conditions that might affect a player's play as is prohibited under Rule 14-3 of "The Rules of Golf," and the score is acceptable for handicap purposes.
However, if a player uses the device or information available through an application or Internet browser to gauge or measure other conditions that might affect a player's play as is prohibited under Rule 14-3 of "The Rules of Golf" (e.g., through use of an anemometer, or a thermometer), the score is unacceptable for handicap purposes. (Revised)
 
            
              5-1e/3. Scores made using an Artificial Device During the Execution of the Stroke
            
              Q: Are scores made using artificial device(s), such as a towel placed under the arms during the execution of the stroke, acceptable for handicap purposes?
            
              A:
               No. If artificial devices, as defined under Rule 14-3, are used during the execution of a stroke, the score is unacceptable for handicap purposes according to Section 5-1e(vii). 
            
              5-2a/1. Requiring Return of Scores Within a Prescribed Period
            
              Q: Since some members of a club have been posting scores up to two months after they were made, would it be proper for the Handicap Committee to require that scores be posted within two weeks of the date on which they were made?
            
              A: Yes. Normally, scores should be posted immediately after the round or as soon as practical. The Handicap Committee may set a reasonable limit within which scores must be posted, taking into account extenuating circumstances.
            
              5-2a/2. Score Made Prior to Revision Date Returned too Late to Use
            
              Q: May 1 is a handicap revision date. On April 30, players played but did not post their scores until May 2. What may the Handicap Committee do?
            
              A: If practical, each player's handicap may be recomputed immediately, using the score made on April 30. When such procedure is not practical, as might be the case if the golf club's scores had been sent to a computation service, the score should be carried forward to the next revision date.
            
              5-2a/3. Requiring the Return of Scorecards for Handicap Purposes
            
              Q: May a Handicap Committee require the returning of scorecards from players in order for a score to be posted?
            
              A: No. However, scorecards may be requested periodically if the Handicap Committee wishes to sample the accuracy with which players are adjusting scores. In any case, the club must not take punitive action regarding the scoring record or the Handicap Index if a scorecard does not accompany a score. 
            
              5-2a/4. Requiring the Return of Scorecards by a Player Whose Handicap Index has been Withdrawn or Modified 
            
              Q: If a player's Handicap Index has been withdrawn or modified by the player's Handicap Committee, and the player is allowed to get a new Handicap Index, may the Handicap Committee require the return of that player's scorecards?
            
              A: Yes, the club Handicap Committee may request the return of scorecards for a probational period from a player who has had a Handicap Index withdrawn or modified. 
            
              5-2a/5. Assigning Scores in Four-Ball (Better-Ball) When the Hole Scores are Left Blank
            
              Q: During a golf club's four-ball (better-ball) tournament, a player leaves two individual hole scores blank on the scorecard because the partner's scores were used on those holes, as allowed under "The Rules of Golf," Rule 31-4. For handicap purposes only, what scores may the Committee enter for the player on those two holes?
            
              A: If the player can be contacted and recall the strokes played on these two holes, the player must record the actual score for each hole, not to exceed the player's Equitable Stroke Control limit. If the player picked up on those holes, the Committee must record the most likely score, had the player completed the holes. (See Section 4-1.)  However, if that information is not available, the Committee must record a score of par plus any handicap strokes to which the player was entitled based on the player's Course Handicap. (See Handicap Decision 4-1/1.)
            
              
                Note
              : For handicap posting purposes, there is a limit to the number of holes a player can leave blank. A player must have played 13 holes for an 18-hole score and 7 for a nine-hole score; therefore, leaving at the most 5 holes blank for an 18-hole score and 2 holes blank for a nine-hole score.
            
              5-2a/6. Internet Score Posting
            
              Q: What are some of the important aspects of Internet Score Posting?
            
              A: Due to the ease of use of the Internet, the USGA believes that golf clubs and Handicap Committees can implement a positive Internet score posting component. Adopting Internet score posting requires that the golf club display scoring records of all members over the Internet as well. This may improve an aspect of peer review by giving members better ability to view other members' scores at any time. These features will continue to enhance the foundation of the golf club and the USGA Handicap System.
            
              5-2a/7. Score to Post if Match Ends in Fewer Than 18 Holes and Player Completes Round
            
              Q: In match play, a player wins the match on the 16th hole. The player plays the remaining two holes. What score may the player post for these two holes?
            
              A: The player should post the actual scores on the post-match holes. To post in any other manner would be at odds with the basic premise that contends that each player will try to make the best scores at every hole in every round. If the Committee believes that the player is inflating hole scores on the post-match holes, it may apply provisions of Section 8. (See 8-4c(iv).) (REVISED)
            
              5-2a/8. Posting Individual Scores Via a Palm-Size and/or Wireless Device
            
              Q: May a player individually post scores using a palm-size device and/or other wireless type device?
            
              A: Yes. A member of a golf club (which has adopted the policy to accept Internet-posted scores) may post scores in this manner as this method is similar in nature to Internet score posting at a computer terminal. Therefore, there is no prohibition against using this type of device. 
            
              5-2a/9. Web site Computation
            
              Q: Can an individual get a Handicap Index from a Web site?
            
              A: No. However, an individual can obtain a Handicap Index from a licensed golf club that follows the USGA Handicap System in its entirety and communicates with its members primarily through a Web site. (See Decision 2/7.)  
            
              5-2c/1. Method for Combining Nine-Hole Scores
            
              Q: What method should be used to combine nine-hole scores when multiple nines are played, such as in a 27-hole Round Robin format?
            
              A: The USGA recommends that the following method be used to combine nine-hole scores in a Round Robin format or in other events when the format requires 27 holes or multiple individual nines: The first two nines played on any day are combined to form an 18-hole score. The third nine is posted as a nine-hole score and becomes a part of the scoring record when combined with another nine-hole score.
            An exception would occur if, for example, a player plays 27 holes in one day, and the first nine is a practice round. If this were the case, the nine-hole practice round would be posted as a nine-hole score, and the subsequent two nine-hole rounds would be combined to form an 18-hole score.
            Both the first two nines and subsequent two nine-hole rounds referenced in this answer are eligible to be combined and designated as an 18-hole tournament score.

            Section 6 SCORING RECORDS
            
              6-1/1. Procedure for Player who Discontinues Play for Lengthy Period and Then Resumes Play
            
              Q: A player with an established Handicap Index discontinues play for a lengthy period, and then resumes play. Should the player use the last Handicap Index on resumption of play or establish a new Handicap Index?
            
              A:
                The player does not have a Handicap Index until the next scheduled handicap revision. The player's club Handicap Committee may issue a Handicap Index (M) sooner if at least five scores exist in the scoring record.
            If the scoring record of the player is unavailable when resuming play, the player has no Handicap Index until five scores have been posted and a handicap revision passes. 
            
              6-2/1. Establishing an Active and an Inactive Season in the Same Area
            
              Q: In the southern part of a state, golf is a 12-month sport, but this is not true in the northern part of the state. What may the authorized golf association do with respect to establishing an inactive season?
            
              A: The golf association may declare an inactive season for the northern part of the state, but not for the southern part.
            
              6-3/1. Display of Scoring Records for Peer Review Purposes
            
              Q:  A player with a Handicap Index has general scoring records readily available on the golf club's Web site and on the Web site of the club's handicap computation service for those involved in peer review. Complete scoring records are available on these sites to fellow club members, the club Handicap Committee, and competition officials of any competition in which the player is going to participate. Is this a violation of the player's right of privacy?
            
              A: No. An essential part of the USGA Handicap System, which includes a Handicap Index, is peer review, and scoring records which includes a Handicap Index list are available for inspection by others, including, but not limited to, fellow members and the club's Handicap Committee. Once a golfer decides to obtain a Handicap Index, the golfer consents to the practice and procedures of the Handicap System, which includes permitting access to this information, and there can be no expectation of privacy with respect to information as to which others will have access. (REVISED) 
            
              6-3/2. Posted Scores Being Readily Available/Scoring Records in a Prominent Location
            
              Q: In Section 5-2, posted scores are to be "readily available." Section 6-3 requires that a list of scoring records (including a Handicap Index list) must be in a "prominent location." What satisfies these requirements? 
            
              A: "Readily available" means easy access to this information. If the sole place where posted scores, scoring records, and a Handicap Index list are kept is in a home, behind a golf shop counter, or in some other area where others cannot access this information easily, these requirements are not being satisfied. If all members of a golf club have Internet access, maintaining a club Web site via the Internet with a distinctive Web site address that displays posted scores, scoring records, and a Handicap Index list will meet these requirements. Using a member's identification number as the sole means of accessing that member's information is not considered making records readily available; some additional means, such as a name search feature, must be offered. 
            
              6-3/3. Display of Member Club Peer Review Information
            
              Q: Is it acceptable for a club or an authorized golf association to provide access to a player's complete scoring record to a club Handicap Chairperson and Committee in charge of a competition?
             
            
              A: Yes. A club or an association is encouraged to provide the complete scoring record information to these parties in that this is the essence of Peer Review.
            
              6-3/4. Request From Competition Officials for Scoring Record
            
              Q: A golf club's Handicap Committee or a Committee in charge of a competition in which a golfer is entered asks another club for the scoring record of one of its members. Is it a violation of the USGA Handicap Policy to refuse such a request? 
            
              A: 
              Refusal to honor such a request is not a violation of the USGA Handicap System, but the USGA encourages clubs to routinely honor such requests so that peer review can take place on a wide-scale basis. A Committee in charge of a competition would be entitled to reject a golfer's application to play in the competition if a request for such information were denied.
            
            
              6-5/1. Maintaining Handicap Index at Only One Club if Belonging to More Than One Club
            
              Q: A player is a member of three golf clubs in a close geographical area. The handicap service does not provide multi-member score routing services and, because of the location of the clubs, it is very inconvenient for the player to post all scores at all three clubs under Section 6-5. Can an exception be made to accommodate this player?
            
              A: Yes. Since the player is a member of more than one club in the same area, a network handicap service is not available to the player, and it is very inconvenient for the player to post all scores at all clubs, the player can designate one club to issue a Handicap Index. The additional conditions are as follows:
            The designated club normally should be the club at which the player plays the most golf; 
            The player's other clubs in the area must agree to delete the player from their handicap records and cease issuing a Handicap Index to that player;
            All scores regardless of where they are played must either be posted at or routed through the player's designated club.
            
              6-5/2. [Reserved]
            
              6-5/3. Procedure when Multi-Club Member's Handicap Index is Modified
            
              Q: A player is a member of multiple golf clubs. One of the clubs has modified the player's Handicap Index under Section 8. What obligation does the club have to notify the other club(s)?
            
              A: The USGA recommends that the club notify all additional clubs where the player receives a Handicap Index. The modified Handicap Index should become the player's Handicap Index at all clubs.

            Section 8 THE HANDICAP COMMITTEE
            
              8-1/1. Status of Owners and Employees
            
              Q: In the definition of Handicap Committee, it states that an employee may not serve as Handicap Chairperson. Is the owner of a golf club considered an employee?  Or an employee of a third party that assists in the operation of a golf club?  Or an employee of a municipality that owns/operates a golf course?
            
              A: In each of these cases, as well as that of a club professional, the person referenced is in a position where pleasing club members is a key responsibility. This makes it difficult for such a person to play an impartial role. These "employees" are not eligible to chair the Handicap Committee of a golf club where they are "employed."  
            
              8-1/1.5. Compensation of Handicap Committee
            
              Q: A company that organizes or operates a golf club pays its Handicap Chairperson. Is this permissible?
            
              A: No. Any individual that receives payment or compensation for performing the duties of a member of the Handicap Committee, including the Handicap Chairperson, is deemed to be an employee and as such is not eligible to serve as the Handicap Chairperson. Compensation or what the USGA considers the equivalent to compensation, puts someone in a position to act like an employee, similar to Decision 8-1/1. This includes, but is not limited to compensation based on a percentage of revenue, paying travel expenses, deriving financial benefit from increased usage of a course, commissions, incentives, etc. A Handicap Chairperson or Committee member may receive a nominal benefit for services rendered, such as waiving the annual membership fee, annual green fees or complimentary use of the club's practice facilities.
            
              8-2m/1. Club Representative No Longer Part of Club and/or Joins New Club
            
              Q: Is the handicap license of a golf club subject to revocation solely because its representative at a USGA Handicap System Seminar is no longer part of the club? 
            
              A: No. If a club representative has participated in a seminar and passed a test exhibiting knowledge about the USGA Handicap System at some point during the term of the license, this requirement is considered to be met through the end of the current term. However, each golf club is encouraged always to have at least one active club representative who has met this requirement. An authorized golf association may have its own requirement that a member club continuously has a club representative who has attended a seminar and passed a test in order for the club to receive certain association membership benefits, but such a requirement does not impact the club's ability to be licensed to utilize the USGA Handicap System. 
            In addition, if the representative of Club A joins Club B, which is in need of the seminar and quiz requirement, this will be considered to have been met for Club B. The club's Handicap Chairperson or a club official should contact the authorized golf association and/or the USGA to update its records when this occurs. (REVISED)
            
              8-3a/1. When a Revised Handicap Index may be Posted
            
              Q: The date on which a club receives a revised Handicap Index list from its computation service varies from month-to-month. For example, earlier this season, a revised Handicap Index list was received three days prior to the next revision, whereas the next month it was received one day prior. May the club post the revised Handicap Index list immediately on receipt or according to the revision schedule?
            
              A: A revised Handicap Index list should be posted on the revision date. The period of time a revised Handicap Index list is held before it is posted should be minimized through coordination with the computation service. (REVISED)
            
              8-4a/1. Limiting Increase in Handicap to Certain Number of Strokes
            
              Q: A club wishes to adopt a regulation under which there would be a limit on the most a player's Handicap Index would be allowed to increase from one revision date to the next. Is the club entitled to adopt such a regulation?
            
              A: No.
            
              8-4c/1. Treatment of Player with Temporary Disability
            
              Q: A player with a Handicap Index of 11.1 discontinued play due to hip replacement surgery. The player has started to play again, but due to recovery and fatigue, the player's three latest scores have been 104, 100, and 102. May the player receive a special adjustment while recovering?
            
              A: The player is entitled to a special adjustment under Section 8-4c(iii). The player should be assigned a temporary local handicap (L) to reflect current ability, as needed during the temporary disability, and it must be identified by the letter "L" to indicate that it is for local use only. The temporary local handicap (L) may be used only with permission of the club Handicap Committee or the Committee in charge of a competition. 
            
              8-4c/2. Treatment of Player with Permanent Disability
            
              Q: Two players have suffered extreme physical disabilities. Both have been able to resume playing golf after not being able to play for many months. Neither will ever be able to play to the Handicap Index established before illness. May these players be entitled to a special adjustment?
            
              A: Yes. The disabilities described appear to be permanent and more extensive than contemplated by Section 8-4c(iii).
            The club Handicap Committee may discard the players' previous scoring records and provide each with a local handicap for use until five scores have been returned to establish a new Handicap Index.
            
              8-4c/3. Player's Handicap Index Experiences Season Fluctuation
            
              Q: Almost every year, a player scores very well (or poorly) during a certain season in comparison to the previous season and the player's Handicap Index changes. The player suggests that this change in scoring is the result of seasonal changes in course conditions. May the Handicap Committee make an adjustment to the player's Handicap Index for this reason?
            
              A: Yes. Changing course conditions by themselves, do not influence a player's potential ability and should not result in a change to a Handicap Index. If the Handicap Committee believes that the player's potential ability is different than the Handicap Index calculated from scores, it is authorized to adjust the player's Handicap Index.
            If this sort of change in scoring is widespread because of changes in course conditions and the Handicap Committee believes it is not practical to maintain course difficulty consistent with its ratings it should consider suspending posting, but must obtain approval from the authorized golf association that issued its ratings if this suspension is to be for an extended period of time.

            Section 9 HANDICAP COMPETITIONS
            
              9-1/1. Requiring Players to use a Handicap Index based on Local Scores
            
              Q: Is it proper to make it a condition of a handicap competition that a Handicap Index must be based on scores made on four local courses?
            
              A: The Committee in charge of the competition is entitled to determine the conditions of the competition. (See "The Rules of Golf," Rule 33-1.) If the Committee requires that players base their handicaps on scores limited to four local courses, these players would not be using a Handicap Index and could not term the handicap a Handicap Index. The USGA Handicap System requires players to return all scores, regardless of where they were made. (See Section 5-1b.)? The USGA recommends that the Committee in charge of a competition require the use of a Handicap Index in order to be fair and equitable.
            
              9-1/2. Prohibiting Players whose Handicap Index is based on Fewer than Ten Scores from Handicap Competition
            
              Q: A Committee has prohibited players whose Handicap Index is based on fewer than ten scores from handicap competitions on the basis that such a Handicap Index is generally higher than a Handicap Index based on ten or more scores. Is this proper?
            
              A: The Committee in charge of the competition is entitled to determine the conditions of competition. (See "The Rules of Golf," Rule 33-1.) The USGA does not recommend prohibiting a player whose Handicap Index is based on fewer than ten scores from the competition because the Handicap Index that is based on fewer than ten scores is just as valid as a Handicap Index that is based on ten or more scores. Furthermore, a player whose Handicap Index is computed from fewer than ten scores has no advantage over other players. (See Section 11-4.)
            
              9-2b/1. Procedure when Play Suspended During Round and Handicap Index Revised Prior to Resumption
            
              Q: A handicap competition was scheduled for a Sunday. The competition began and was interrupted because of rain, and play was suspended for the day.
            Play was resumed on the following Saturday. In the meantime, a revised Handicap Index list had been received and was posted.
            A condition of the competition provided that players should use their Handicap Index in effect at the time each round was played. Should the players have used the Handicap Index with which they started the round or the Handicap Index in effect on the day on which play was resumed?
            
              A: The Handicap Index in effect at the beginning of the round should have been used until the round was completed, even though the players? Handicap Index had been revised.
            
              9-3a/1. Handicap Allowance in Singles Match Play when a Player with a Plus Handicap Competing
            
              Q: In a match, A?s Course Handicap is plus 2 and B?s Course Handicap is 8. How many strokes may B receive?
            
              A: The USGA recommends that B receive 10 strokes, and A play at scratch.
            
              9-3a/2. Handicap Allowance in a Four-Ball Match when a Player with a Plus Handicap Involved
            
              Q: In a four-ball match played on a handicap basis, the Course Handicap of each player involved is as follows: player A has a plus 2, player B has a 6, player C has a 2, and player D has a 4. How should Course Handicap be allocated?
            
              A: The USGA recommends that player A receive no strokes, player B receive 8 strokes, player C receive 4 strokes, and player D receive 6 strokes. (See Section 9-4a(iii).)
            
              9-3a/3. Handicap Strokes Given or Received in Four-Ball Stroke Play when Partner has a Plus Handicap
            
              Q: In a four-ball stroke play net competition, A and B are partners. A?s Course Handicap is plus 2 and B?s is 2. On which holes may handicap-strokes be received or given?
            
              A: A should add one stroke on the holes allocated as the 17th and 18th handicap-stroke holes. B should deduct one stroke on the holes allocated as the 1st and 2nd handicap-stroke holes. (See Section 9-4b(ii).)
            
              9-3a/4. Minus or Zero Net Score?
            
              Q: In a handicap match, a player entitled to two handicap strokes at a par-3 hole scores a 2 or a hole-in-one.? What would be the player?s net score in each case?
            
              A: The player?s net score would be zero (0) if the player scored a 2 or minus one (-1) if the player had a hole-in-one. The same would be true in a four-ball stroke play or Stableford competition since scores are calculated on a hole-by-hole basis. (See ?The Decisions on the Rules of Golf,? 2-1/2.) 
            
              9-4a/1. Players Choose to Use Full Handicaps in Singles Match Play
            
              Q: In singles match play, player A has a Course Handicap of 17 and player B has a Course Handicap of 13. Based on Section 9-4a(i), player A may receive four strokes from player B on the holes allocated as the first four handicap-stroke holes. The players decide to play the match with their full Course Handicap, A taking a handicap stroke on 17 holes and B taking a handicap stroke on 13 holes. Is this procedure equitable?
            
              A: No. Handicap-stroke holes are established to maximize the number of halved holes in a match by assigning strokes where player A most needs four strokes in order to obtain a half on those holes. If both A and B receive strokes on those four holes, the better player (B) will have a greater chance of winning those holes. On holes allocated 14, 15, 16, and 17, A will receive strokes and B will not. A will have a greater chance of winning those holes. The result will be more holes won and lost than halved and the better player (B) will have an advantage in the match.
            
              9-4a/2. Handicap Allowance in Four-Ball Match if One Player Unable to Compete
            
              Q: In a four-ball match played on a handicap basis, the player with the lowest Course Handicap is unable to play. May the absent player be disregarded in determining handicap allowances?
            
              A:
               No. The Course Handicap of the three players may be reduced by the Course Handicap of the absent player, and the three players may be allowed 100 percent of the resulting difference. If an incorrect Course Handicap is declared for the absent player, Section 3-6a applies. (?The Rules of Golf,? Rule 30-3a, 30-3e(i), and Decision 30-3a/3 of ?The Decisions on the Rules of Golf.?)
            
            
              9-4a/3. Result of a Hole if Men?s and Women?s Par is Different
            
              Q: In a match-play competition, one hole is par four for men and par five for women. In a match between a man and a woman, if both score par, what is the result of the hole?
            
              A: Par is irrelevant. The player who completes the hole in fewer strokes wins the hole.
            
              9-4b/1. Handicap Allowance in Foursome Stroke Play when a Player with a Plus Handicap Involved
            
              Q: In foursome stroke play, a competitor?s Course Handicap is plus 1 and the partner?s Course Handicap is 12. How many handicap strokes does the side receive?
            
              A: The side receives 50 percent of 11 strokes, which is 5.5, rounded to 6 strokes.

            Section 10 USGA HANDICAP FORMULA
            
              10-3/1. Designation of Tournament Score when Points are Awarded for a Year-End Prize
            
              Q: On ladies' day, when no special event is planned, there is a low gross-low net competition. Points are awarded for finishing first, second, and third in each flight. At the end of the season, prizes are awarded to the player in each flight who has accumulated the most points. Are these scores considered tournament scores?
            
              A: No. The end-of-season winners are not all required to play the same number of stipulated rounds.
            
              10-3/2. Designation of Tournament Score when the Prize is a Golf Ball
            
              Q: Is a score from a competition that offers only a golf ball as a prize posted as a tournament score?
            
              A: The value or nature of a prize is not a factor in determining whether a score is posted as a tournament score. Scores must be identified by the letter "T" when posted if they meet the definition of a tournament score. (See tournament score and Section 10-3.)
            
              10-3/3. Designation of Tournament Score When Entries Are Accepted at Starting Time
            
              Q: Our club professional organizes competitions that you can enter just before you go out to play. The prizes are predicated on how many players enter the competition that day. May these scores be posted as tournament scores?
            
              A: If the club's Tournament Committee has authorized the club professional to conduct the competition, they have determined the selection of the winner(s) will be based on stipulated round(s) and played under "The Rules of Golf" (and the Committee has announced in advance that the score be identified by the letter "T"), scores from such events may be posted as tournament scores. The timing of acceptance of entries and the nature of the prizes do not affect whether a score is a tournament score. Events such as women's or seniors' weekly play days normally are not to be designated as T-Scores because they are not significant in the traditions, schedules, formats and membership of the club. One example of a significant event is one that is scheduled to be held annually.
            
              10-3/4. Designation of Tournament Score When Pairings Are Not Made and Starting Times Are Not Assigned
            
              Q: Our club has a Tournament Committee that sets up weekly competitions with modest prizes but does not make pairings or post starting times. May these scores be posted as tournament scores?
            
              A: The fact that specific starting times and pairings are not assigned in advance does not alone determine the status of a competition. The fact that prizes are modest has no bearing. (See Decision 10-3/2.) The club's Tournament Committee must decide whether any of the scores from these weekly competitions meet the definition of a tournament score for posting purposes. That is, the competition must be organized and conducted by a Committee, and the selection of the winner(s) must be based on a stipulated round(s) and it must be played under "The Rules of Golf." If so, the Committee must announce in advance that the scores must be identified by the letter "T" when posted. If the competition, in the judgment of the Handicap Committee, would identify such players, the Committee may announce that scores from the competition must be identified as tournament scores when posted. However, events such as women's or seniors' weekly play days normally are not to be designated as T-Scores because they are not significant in the traditions, schedules, formats and membership of the club. One example of a significant event is one that is scheduled to be held annually. Careful consideration should be given to the possibility that too many events identified as Tournament Scores inhibits Section 10-3 from effectively identifying and reducing the Handicap Index of players who excel in competition. (REVISED)
            
              10-3/5. Designation of Tournament Score From Weekly Club Sweep
            
              Q: Our Committee read above Decisions 10-3/3 and 10-3/4. We conduct a weekly sweep every Wednesday. The groups are made up with participants and non-participants as they arrive to play. Players entering the sweep give the Pro $2 for the prize pool. There are no posted pairings or starting times. Winners receive gift certificates equal to the prize pool of the day. Some Wednesday formats conform totally to "The Rules of Golf" and others do not. All of these scores are eligible for the annual ringers tournament. May these scores be designated as tournament scores?
            
              A: Scores made in events which do not conform to "The Rules of Golf" generally may not be designated as tournament scores. None of the stated factors by themselves would prevent the Committee from designating scores in these competitions as tournament scores. The purpose of the tournament scores procedure is to identify players who excel in competition well beyond their current Handicap Index. If the competition, in the judgment of the Handicap Committee, would identify such players, the Committee may announce that scores from the competition must be identified as tournament scores when posted. The club Committee is best qualified to make the decision because it knows its traditions, schedules, formats, and members. However, events such as women's or men's weekly play days normally are not to be designated as T-scores because they are not significant in the traditions, schedules, formats, and membership of the club. One example of a significant event is one that is scheduled to be held annually.
            
              10-3/6. Designation of Tournament Score When Fewer Than 13 Holes Are Played
            
              Q: In a match play tournament, a match ends on the eleventh hole. May this score be posted as a tournament score?
            
              A: No. A tournament score must have at least 13 holes played under tournament conditions for it to be designated as a tournament score.

            Section 16 PAR COMPUTATION
            
              16/1. Failure of Club to Establish Par in Accordance with USGA Guidelines
            
              Q: What may be done if par is not established in accordance with Section 16?  For example, a club has designated a 330-yard hole without any unusual features as a par-5 for women. This designation is well outside the USGA guidelines. Must clubs using the USGA Handicap System establish par within the guidelines?
            
              A: Yes. If notified in writing, the USGA will request the authorized golf association in the area to contact the club about changing par. If the golf association is unable to persuade the club to change par on the hole, the USGA will write to the club requesting the change.
