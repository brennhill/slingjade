However, as illustrated in the paragraph below, a large degree of uncertainty can be associated with determining a value to assign to an entry into the Pro-Am competition that is won as a prize in a qualifying competition. When considering whether an amateur golfer can accept an entry into a Pro-Am competition as a prize and retain his Amateur Status, the Committee should consider the alternative ways of gaining entry into the Pro-Am. </p></div>
      <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">For example, interested amateur golfers can pay the published fee for a spot in the competition, or entry fees may be discounted if multiple entries are purchased by the same individual. In some cases, the entry fee is based on the ranking of the professional that will be playing in the group with the amateur golfer. In other cases, the Pro-Am organizers may offer free entries into the Pro-Am to members of the club where the Pro-Am is conducted in gratitude for the members allowing use of the club for the competition, or for work performed by the members in support of the competition (e.g., chairman of the tournament committee). Finally, in other cases a qualifying competition may be conducted where an entry into the Pro-Am is awarded as a prize.</p></div>
      <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">Therefore, the value of the spot in the Pro-Am as the prize to the winner of the qualifying competition is deemed to be equal to the prize limit and acceptance of the prize would not jeopardize the Amateur Status of the winner, provided:</p></div>
