  <h2 class="sectionhead">Foreword - To the 2012 Rules of Amateur Status </h2>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">Foreword to the 2012 Rules of Amateur Status </h3>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Amateurism in sport is much less common today than in the past. As the governing authorities for the Rules of the game, the United States Golf Association ("USGA") and R&amp;A Rules Limited ("The R&amp;A") have, therefore, conducted a fundamental review of the Rules of Amateur Status ("the Rules") over the past four years. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The USGA and R&amp;A have concluded that the distinction between amateur and professional golf should be maintained and that the wholesale removal of the limits and restrictions placed on amateur golfers is not in the best interests of the modern game. In particular, it is agreed that because amateur golf is largely self-regulating, both in terms of the playing Rules and handicapping, uncontrolled financial incentive could place too much pressure on these important features and could be detrimental to the integrity of the game.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The fundamental aims of the new Rules are: </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>• an internationally accepted position that is in the best interests of the game; </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>• a modern Code that, where appropriate, is faithful to the traditions of the game; </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>• a Code that has longevity and is enforceable; and </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>• a Code that works for all aspects of the game (i.e., club golf, elite amateur golf and professional golf (at its various levels)). </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Through appropriate limits and restrictions, the Rules are intended to encourage amateur golfers to focus on the game's challenges and inherent rewards, rather than any financial gain. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The USGA and R&amp;A believe that this new Code strikes the right balance in preserving the traditional character of the amateur game while acknowledging that young, talented golfers may need more support. At the same time, it recognizes that varying social and economic conditions create different challenges for individuals and organizations from country to country and that emerging golfing countries, in particular, may need more liberal and flexible structures to help the game develop. The principal changes are summarized on pages 7 and 8. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>It is against that background that the USGA and R&amp;A have formulated these new Rules of Amateur Status. </p></div>

  <h4 class="letterhead">a. Awaiting Reinstatement </h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Amateur and professional golf are two distinct forms of the game which provide different opportunities and neither benefits if the process of changing status from professional to amateur is too easy. Furthermore, there needs to be a deterrent against all breaches of the <em><a href="rule-14325.html#Rules">Rules</a></em>. Therefore, an applicant for reinstatement to Amateur Status must undergo a period awaiting reinstatement as prescribed by the <em><a href="rule-14325.html#Committee">Committee</a></em>. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The period awaiting reinstatement generally starts from the date of the person's last breach of the <em><a href="rule-14325.html#Rules">Rules</a></em> unless the <em><a href="rule-14325.html#Committee">Committee</a></em> decides that it starts from either (a) the date when the person's last breach became known to the <em><a href="rule-14325.html#Committee">Committee</a></em>, or (b) such other date determined by the <em><a href="rule-14325.html#Committee">Committee</a></em>. </p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>It is recommended that the following guidelines on periods awaiting reinstatement be applied by the <em><a href="rule-14325.html#Committee">Committee</a></em>: </p></div>

  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">(ii) Other Breaches of the Rules </h3>
