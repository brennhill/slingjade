  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="a_text">A match that ends all square should be played off hole by hole until one side wins a hole.

  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">Stroke Play </h3>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="a_text">(a) In the event of a tie in a scratch stroke-play competition, a play-off is recommended. The play-off may be over 18 holes or a smaller number of holes as specified by the Committee. If that is not feasible or there is still a tie, a hole-by-hole play-off is recommended. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="a_text">(b) In the event of a tie in a handicap stroke-play competition, a play-off with handicaps is recommended.

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="a_text_indent">In competitions where the handicap stroke allocation table is not relevant, if the play-off is less than 18 holes, the percentage of 18 holes played should be applied to the players' handicaps to determine their play-off handicaps.

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="a_text_indent">In competitions where the handicap stroke table is relevant, such as four-ball stroke play and bogey, par and Stableford competitions, handicap strokes should be taken as they were assigned for the competition using the players' respective stroke allocation table(s). </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="a_text">(c) If a play-off of any type is not feasible, matching score cards is recommended. The method of matching cards should be announced in advance and should also provide what will happen if this procedure does not produce a winner. An acceptable method of matching cards is to determine the winner on the basis of the best score for the last nine holes. If the tying players have the same score for the last nine, determine the winner on the basis of the last six holes, last three holes and finally the 18th hole. If this method is used in a competition with a multiple tee start, it is recommended that the "last nine holes, last six holes, etc." is considered to be holes 10-18, 13-18, etc. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="a_text_indent">For competitions where the handicap stroke table is not relevant, such as individual stroke play, if the last nine, last six, last three holes scenario is used, one-half, one-third, one-sixth, etc. of the handicaps should be deducted from the score for those holes.

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>For purposes of determining places in the draw, ties in qualifying rounds other than those for the last qualifying place are decided by the order in which scores are returned, with the first score to be returned receiving the lowest available number, etc. If it is impossible to determine the order in which scores are returned, ties are determined by a blind draw. </p></div>
