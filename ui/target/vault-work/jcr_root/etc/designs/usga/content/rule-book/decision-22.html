Or may A also have B's ball lifted if it is off his line of play but catches his eye and thus constitutes mental interference?</p></div>

B requests A to lift his ball under Rule <a href="rule-22.html#22-2">22-2</a> as it might interfere with his (B's) play. This happens several times during the round. Is such procedure permissible?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>Rule <a href="rule-22.html#22">22</a> is intended to cover situations where there is a reasonable possibility that one ball might assist or interfere with another ball. If the Rule is being abused, as in this case, the Committee would be justified in penalizing B for undue delay (Rule <a href="rule-06.html#6-7">6-7</a>).</p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>In a match between A and B, A's ball is near the hole in a position to serve as a backstop for B's ball. A lifts his ball to clean it. B requests A to replace his ball before he (B) putts. A protests but B insists that, under the Rules, A must replace his ball immediately. A replaces his ball but disputes B's right to require him to do so and claims the hole. B putts and his ball strikes A's ball and stops very close to the hole. A replaces his ball and holes out for a 4. B then holes out for a 4. The match continues and the claim is later referred to the Committee. How should the Committee rule?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>The hole stands as played. The Rules do not require A to replace his ball, but B was not in breach of the Rules by asking A to replace it - see Rule <a href="rule-22.html#22-1">22-1</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>No. If A and B agree not to lift a ball that might assist B, both players are disqualified under Rule <a href="rule-22.html#22-1">22-1</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>In stroke play, a competitor's ball is in a position to assist the play of a fellow-competitor and the competitor is in a position to lift the ball under Rule <a href="rule-22.html#22-1">22-1</a> without delaying the fellow-competitor's play. However, the competitor does not take any action to invoke the Rule. Would a referee be justified in intervening and requesting the competitor to invoke the Rule to protect himself and the rest of the field?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>Yes. If the competitor were to object, there would be strong evidence of an agreement not to lift the ball for the purpose of assisting the fellow-competitor in breach of Rule <a href="rule-22.html#22-1">22-1</a>. The referee would be justified in so advising the competitors involved and warning that failure to lift the ball would result in disqualification under Rule <a href="rule-22.html#22-1">22-1</a>.</p></div>
