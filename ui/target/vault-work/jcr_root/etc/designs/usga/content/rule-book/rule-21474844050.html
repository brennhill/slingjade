  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>A player in doubt as to whether use of a device or other equipment would constitute a breach of the <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Rule-Or-Rules">Rules</a></em> should consult the USGA. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>A manufacturer should submit to the USGA a sample of a device or other equipment to be manufactured for a ruling as to whether its use during a <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Stipulated-Round">stipulated round</a></em> would cause a player to be in breach of Rule <a href="rule-14.html#14-3">14-3</a>. The sample becomes the property of the USGA for reference purposes. If a manufacturer fails to submit a sample or, having submitted a sample, fails to await a ruling before manufacturing and/or marketing the device or other equipment, the manufacturer assumes the risk of a ruling that use of the device or other equipment would be contrary to the <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Rule-Or-Rules">Rules</a></em>. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The following paragraphs prescribe general regulations for the design of devices and other equipment, together with specifications and interpretations. They should be read in conjunction with Rule <a href="rule-11.html#11-1">11-1</a> (Teeing) and Rule <a href="rule-14.html#14-3">14-3</a> (Artificial Devices, Unusual Equipment and Unusual Use of Equipment). </p></div>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">1. Tees (Rule <a href="rule-11.html#11">11</a>) </h3>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>A tee is a device designed to raise the ball off the ground. A tee must not: </p></div>
  <ul>
    <li>be longer than 4 inches (101.6 mm); </li>
    <li>be designed or manufactured in such a way that it could indicate <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Line-Of-Play">line of play</a></em>; </li>
    <li>unduly influence the movement of the ball; or </li>
    <li>otherwise assist the player in making a <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Stroke">stroke</a></em> or in his play. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">2. Gloves (Rule <a href="rule-14.html#14-3">14-3</a>) </h3>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Gloves may be worn to assist the player in gripping the club, provided they are plain. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>A "plain" glove must: </p></div>
  <ul>
    <li>consist of a fitted covering of the hand with a separate sheath or opening for each digit (fingers and thumb); and </li>
    <li>be made of smooth materials on the full palm and gripping surface of the digits. </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>A "plain" glove must not incorporate: </p></div>
  <ul>
    <li> material on the gripping surface or inside of the glove, the primary purpose of which is to provide padding or which has the effect of providing padding. Padding is defined as an area of glove material which is more than 0.025 inches (0.635 mm) thicker than the adjacent areas of the glove without the added material; 

<strong></strong><div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="a_note_indent"><strong>Note:</strong> Material may be added for wear resistance, moisture absorption or other functional purposes, provided it does not exceed the definition of padding (see above).
</p></div></li>
    <li>straps to assist in preventing the club from slipping or to attach the hand to the club; </li>
    <li>any means of binding digits together; </li>
    <li>material on the glove that adheres to material on the grip; </li>
    <li>features, other than visual aids, designed to assist the player in placing his hands in a consistent and/or specific position on the grip; </li>
    <li>weight to assist the player in making a <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Stroke">stroke</a></em>; </li>
    <li>any feature that might restrict the movement of a joint; or </li>
    <li>any other feature that might assist the player in making a <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Stroke">stroke</a></em> or in his play. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">3. Shoes (Rule <a href="rule-14.html#14-3">14-3</a>) </h3>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Shoes that assist the player in obtaining a firm stance may be worn. Subject to the conditions of competition, features such as spikes on the sole are permitted, but shoes must not incorporate features: </p></div>
  <ul>
    <li>designed to assist the player in taking his <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Stance">stance</a></em> and/or building a <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Stance">stance</a></em>; </li>
    <li> designed to assist the player with his alignment; or </li>

  </ul>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">5. Distance-Measuring Devices (Rule <a href="rule-14.html#14-3">14-3</a>) </h3>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>During a <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Stipulated-Round">stipulated round</a></em>, the use of any distance measuring device is not permitted unless the Committee has introduced a Local Rule to that effect (see Note to Rule <a href="rule-14.html#14-3">14-3</a> and Appendix I; Part B; Section 9). </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Even when the Local Rule is in effect, the device must be limited to measuring distance only. Features that would render use of the device contrary to the Local Rule include, but are not limited to: </p></div>
  <ul>
    <li>the gauging or measuring of slope; </li>
    <li>the gauging or measuring of other conditions that might affect play (e.g., wind speed or direction, or other climate-based information such as temperature, humidity, etc.); </li>
    <li>recommendations that might assist the player in making a <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Stroke">stroke</a></em> or in his play (e.g., club selection, type of shot to be played, green reading or any other advice related matter); or </li>
    <li>calculating the effective distance between two points based on slope or other conditions affecting shot distance. </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Such non-conforming features render use of the device contrary to the <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Rule-Or-Rules">Rules</a></em>, irrespective of whether or not: </p></div>
  <ul>
    <li>the features can be switched off or disengaged; and </li>
    <li>the features are switched off or disengaged. </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>A multi-functional device, such as a smartphone or PDA, may be used as a distance measuring device provided it contains a distance measuring application that meets all of the above limitations (i.e., it must measure distance only). In addition, when the distance measuring application is being used, there must be no other features or applications installed on the device that, if used, would be in breach of the <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Rule-Or-Rules">Rules</a></em>, whether or not they are actually used.</p></div>
