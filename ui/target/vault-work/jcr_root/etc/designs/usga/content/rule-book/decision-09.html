Thus, informing the opponent "as soon as practicable" of a penalty incurred does not, in all circumstances mean that the player must do so before the opponent plays his next stroke.</p></div>

Incorrect information would not affect the opponent's understanding of the result of the hole in the following circumstances: A and B are playing a match. After play of a hole, A states that he scored 5 and B states that he (B) scored 7. After teeing off at the next hole, A states that he was incorrect in saying that he scored 5 and that, in fact, he scored 6.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">In Decision <a href="decision-09.html#d9-2-14">9-2/14</a>, the incorrect information caused B to believe that the hole in question had been halved, when in fact B lost the hole. Accordingly, if A had not corrected the error before playing from the next tee, under Rule <a href="rule-09.html#9-2">9-2</a> the hole would have been awarded to B.</p></div>

In view of the wording in Rule <a href="rule-09.html#9-2a">9-2a</a>, under which an opponent is entitled to ascertain from the player the number of strokes he has taken, may A go forward to determine the status of B's ball before he (A) plays from the tee?</p></div>

    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>No. A would be in breach of Rule <a href="rule-06.html#6-7">6-7</a> (Undue Delay) if he did so. A player may make such a determination only if it can be done without unduly delaying play.</p></div>

  <h4 class="q_topic">Competitor in Hole-by-Hole Play-Off Gives Wrong Information</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>In a stroke-play hole-by-hole play-off, B has completed the hole in 5 strokes. Having no other readily available means for determining B's score at that point, A, who has a putt for a 5, inquires as to the number of strokes B has taken for the hole. B wrongly states that he (B) has holed out in 4 strokes. A picks up his ball without marking its position based on his understanding that B had won the play-off. B then corrects his error. What is the ruling?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>If B intentionally misled A, B is disqualified under Rule <a href="rule-33.html#33-7">33-7</a>.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">If B simply made a mistake, B incurs no penalty. Rule <a href="rule-09.html#9">9</a> imposes no penalty for giving wrong information as to the number of strokes in stroke play. In these exceptional circumstances, A incurs no penalty for lifting his ball at rest without marking it. In a stroke-play hole-by-hole play-off, it is not necessary for A to complete the hole if B is the winner (see Decision <a href="decision-33.html#d33-6-3">33-6/3</a>), and since A had no other readily available means for determining B's score at that point, it was reasonable for A to rely on B's answer. Accordingly, by providing the incorrect information that induced A to lift his ball, B (not A) should be deemed to have caused the movement of A's ball. Therefore, in these limited circumstances, Rule <a href="rule-18.html#18-4">18-4</a> applies, i.e., neither player incurs a penalty and A must replace his ball - see Decision <a href="decision-18.html#d18-1-8">18-1/8</a> and Decision <a href="decision-18.html#d18-2a-21">18-2a/21</a>. This answer only applies in a stroke-play hole-by-hole play-off. In all other cases during a stroke-play competition, A would be obliged in all events to complete play of the hole and it would therefore not be reasonable for A to lift his ball without marking it.</p></div>
