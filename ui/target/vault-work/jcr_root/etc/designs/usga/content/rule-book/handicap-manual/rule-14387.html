          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Whether a player's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> may be changed during a competition is a matter for the Committee in charge of the competition to determine and publish prior to the competition. Rule 33-1 of "The Rules of Golf" provides in part: that the Committee must lay down the conditions under which a competition is to be played. </p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The Committee may, in an exceptional individual case, modify a player's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> before or between rounds of the competition; however, a player's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#HandicapIndex">Handicap Index</a></em> can only be adjusted by the player's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#HandicapCommittee">Handicap Committee</a></em>. (See Section <a href="rule-14385.html#8-4">8-4c</a>.)</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The USGA recommends that, when practical, each player use the <em><a href="rule-14370.html#HandicapIndex">Handicap Index</a></em> in effect at the time each round is played. If a competition spans a handicap revision date, the revised <em><a href="rule-14370.html#HandicapIndex">Handicap Index</a></em> should be used in rounds following that date. (See Decision <a href="decision-14387.html#9-2b/1">9-2b/1</a>)</p></div>

          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>If a player belongs to more than one <em><a href="rule-14370.html#golfclub">golf club</a></em> and has a different <em><a href="rule-14370.html#HandicapIndex">Handicap Index</a></em> at each <a title="golf club" href="rule-14370.html#golfclub"><em>golf club</em></a>, the Committee in charge of a competition should require the player to use the lowest <em><a href="rule-14370.html#HandicapIndex">Handicap Index</a></em> when competing with players from more than one club. (See Section <a href="rule-14381.html#6-5">6-5</a> and Decision <a title="6-5/2" href="decision-14381.html#6-5/2">6-5/2</a> and Decision <a title="6-5/3" href="decision-14381.html#6-5/3" target="_parent">6-5/3</a>.)</p></div>

          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>If handicap strokes are applied to a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#grossscore">gross score</a></em>, subtract the player's handicap strokes (usually the <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em>) recorded on the scorecard. The result is the player's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#netscore">net score</a></em>.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>In stroke play, the Committee is responsible for the addition of scores and the application of the  <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> recorded on the score card.  ("The Rules of Golf," Rule 33-5).</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>For formats in which handicap strokes are used on specific holes during the course of play, a player generally takes them in the order assigned on the scorecard. For example, a player receiving three strokes takes them on the first, second, and third stroke holes. However, the Committee in charge of the competition is permitted to assign a custom order. If so, it must publish a "stroke allocation table" indicating the order of holes at which handicap strokes are to be given or received. For example, while the score card may assign holes 3, 13, and 8 as the first, second, and third stroke holes, the Committee may choose to designate 4, 12, and 7 instead. ("The Rules of Golf," Rule 33-4).</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>In mixed competitions where players play their own ball and where allocations are different for men and women, the players receive strokes based on their respective stroke allocations.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>In mixed foursome and selected drive match play competitions, strokes are received based on the men's allocation.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
            <img width="10" height="10" align="absBottom" src="../img/bc0e0f62-e16f-4102-990a-2696b8190dae.gif" /> b. Where to Apply Strokes, Plus Handicaps</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>A player with a plus <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> must add strokes according to the allocation table beginning with the 18th stroke hole. For example, when a player with a plus <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> competes in a partnership stroke play competition, a side with a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of plus 1 must add a stroke to its score on the hole designated as the 18th stroke hole. In a match play competition, if the lower-handicapped side has a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of plus 1, that side plays at scratch, and adds 1 stroke to the other side's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em>. (See Decisions <a href="decision-14387.html#9-3a/1">9-3a/1</a>, <a href="decision-14387.html#9-3a/2">9-3a/2</a>, and <a href="decision-14387.html#9-3a/3">9-3a/3</a>.)</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>When a plus-handicap player is part of a side, the percentage allowances, for different types of play (as described in Section <a href="rule-14387.html#9-4">9-4</a>), bring that player's Course Handicap closer to zero (e.g., 50% of a +3 is a +1.5, which rounds to +1<font size="3" face="Arial, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: 18px;">)</span></font><span style="line-height: 1.231;">. This occurs in order to keep as close as possible the proper percentage spread between the plus-handicap player and the other members of the side.</span></p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
            <em>Example:</em> On side A-B, Player A has a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of +5 and Player B has a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of 10. The total spread between <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> is 15 strokes. In a competition where 80% of each player's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> is used, Player A becomes a +4 (+5 x 80%) and Player B becomes an 8 (10 x 80%). The spread between <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em>, after the allowance is 12, which is 80% of their original spread of 15.</p></div>

          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
            <strong>(i) Different Tees: Men vs. Men; Women vs. Women; Women vs. Men</strong>
            <br />Different tees usually have different ratings. Since a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> reflects the probable scores of <em><a href="rule-14370.html#ScratchGolfer">scratch golfers</a></em>, the higher-rated course is more difficult, and the player playing from the set of tees with the higher <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> receives additional stroke(s) equal to the difference between each <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em>, with the resulting figure rounded off to the nearest whole number (.5 or more is rounded upward). (See Decision <a href="decision-14373.html#3-5/1">3-5/1</a>.) <br /><br /><em>Example 1:</em> If men playing from the middle tees, from which the men's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> is 70.3, compete against men playing from the back tees, from which the men's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> is 72.6, the men playing from the back tees will add two strokes <br />(72.6 - 70.3 = 2.3 rounded to 2) to <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em>.<br /><br /><em>Example 2:</em> If women playing from the forward tees, from which the women's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> is 73.4, compete against men playing from the middle tees, from which the men's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> is 70.9, the women will add three strokes (73.4 - 70.9 = 2.5 rounded to 3) to <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em>.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
            <strong>(ii) Same Tees: Men vs. Women</strong>
            <br />Men and women playing from the same set of tees will have different ratings. Since the women's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> usually will be higher, women receive additional strokes equal to the difference between men's and women's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em>, with the resulting figure rounded off to the nearest whole number (.5 or more is rounded upward). (See Decision <a href="decision-14373.html#3-5/1">3-5/1</a> for an exception.)<br /><br /><em>Example:</em> If women playing from the middle tees, from which the women's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> is 77.3, compete against men playing from the same tees, from which the men's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> is 70.9, the women will add six strokes (77.3 - 70.9 = 6.4 or 6) to <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em>.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
            <strong>(iii) Foursome Competitions Using Different Tees or Men and Women Using Same Tees</strong>
            <br />In foursome competitions using different tees or men and women from the same tees, players use half the difference in <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> between sets of tees. <br /><br /><em>Example:</em> A, a man, and B, a woman, are partners in a foursome competition against C, a man, and D, a woman. The men play the white tees with a USGA Course Rating of 71.2, and the women play the red tees with a USGA Course Rating of 73.6. The difference in Ratings is 2.4. After the <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of each team is determined, one-half of the difference between Ratings (1 stroke) is added to the <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of each team with the resulting figure rounded off to the nearest whole number (.5 or more is rounded upward). If A and B are both men, the procedure applies only to side C and D (a man and a woman).<br /><br />In a foursome competition in which sides are using different tees, the side playing from the set of tees with the higher <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> receives additional strokes equal to the difference between Ratings with the resulting figure rounded off to the nearest whole number (.5 or more is rounded upward). (See Decision <a href="decision-14373.html#3-5/1">3-5/1</a>.)<br /><br /><em>Example:</em> A, a man, and C, a man, are partners in a foursome competition against B, a woman, and D, a woman. The men play the white tees, with a USGA Course Rating of 71.2, and the women play the red tees, with a USGA Course Rating of 73.6. The difference in Rating is 2.4. After the <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of each team is determined, the full difference between the Ratings (2 strokes) is added to the <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of the women's team.<br /><br /><em>Note:</em> Additional strokes received under this procedure are to be disregarded when applying <em><a href="rule-14370.html#equitableStrokeControl">ESC</a></em> for handicap purposes. (See Section <a href="rule-14377.html#4-3">4-3</a>, Example 3.)</p></div>

            <em>
              <a href="rule-14370.html#handicapallowance">Handicap allowances</a>
            </em> have no effect in determining a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#HandicapIndex">Handicap Index</a></em>; however, their use is recommended to produce fair and equitable competition.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>A <em><a href="rule-14370.html#HandicapIndex">Handicap Index</a> </em>relates to 18 holes.  Each allowance in Section 9-4 applies to an 18-hole round, even though the competition may consist of more than one round.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The allowances are designed to make all forms of play fair. In some forms of play, it is equitable for players to use full <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em>. In some team competitions, using full <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> would give higher-handicapped sides an advantage over lower-handicapped sides. Less than full <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> is recommended in some team competitions.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>To make proper use of <em><a href="rule-14370.html#handicapallowance">handicap allowances</a>,</em> follow the order of the steps below:</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Step 1: Players must first determine <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> (from tees played).</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Step 2: Players should then apply the <em><a href="rule-14370.html#handicapallowance">handicap allowances</a></em> for the appropriate format.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Step 3: It is recommended that in four-ball stroke play competitions, if the<em> <a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a> </em>of the side differ by more than eight strokes, each is reduced by 10 percent. (See Note in Section <a title="9-4b(ii)" href="rule-14387.html#9-4" target="_parent">9-4b(ii)</a>.) </p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Step 4: If players are competing from different tees or men and women are competing from the same tees (See Sections <a href="rule-14373.html#3-5">3-5</a> and <a href="rule-14387.html#9-3">9-3</a>c), players must apply the adjustment for the difference in <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> from the tees played.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>For example, a competition in which players using a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#handicapallowance">handicap allowance</a></em> of 80 percent are playing from two sets of tees where the difference in <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> is four strokes.

            <strong>(vi) Foursome Stroke Play</strong>
            <br />In foursome stroke play, two players form a side and the partners play one ball. The partners play alternately from the teeing grounds and alternately during the play of each hole ("The Rules of Golf," 29-1). After <em><a href="rule-14370.html#handicapallowance">handicap allowances</a></em> are determined, Section <a href="rule-14387.html#9-3">9-3c</a>(iii) must be applied in competitions from different tees, or in competitions between men and women from the same tees.<br /><br />Allowance: The allowance is 50 percent of the partners' combined <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em>. When selected drives are permitted, the allowance is 40 percent. A plus combined <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> side must be added to the <em><a href="rule-14370.html#grossscore">gross score</a></em> to determine the <em><a href="rule-14370.html#netscore">net score</a></em>. <br /><br /><em>Example:</em> On side A-B, Player A has a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of 5 and Player B has a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of 12. Side AB's combined <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> is 17. Side A-B will receive 9 strokes (17 x 50% = 8.5, rounded to 9).</p></div>

            <strong>(vii) Chapman or Pinehurst Stroke Play</strong>
            <br />In Chapman or Pinehurst stroke play, two players play as partners, each partner plays from the teeing ground and plays the partner's ball for the second shot. After the second shot, partners select the ball with which they wish to score and play that ball alternately to complete the hole. After <em><a href="rule-14370.html#handicapallowance">handicap allowances</a></em> are determined, Section <a href="rule-14387.html#9-3">9-3c</a> must be applied in competitions from different tees or in competitions between men and women from the same tees. <br /><br />Allowance: The player with the lower <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> is allowed 60 percent of <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em>. The player with the higher <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> is allowed 40 percent of <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em>. <br /><br /><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> On side A-B, Player A has a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of 10 and Player B has a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of 18. 60% of Player A's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> is 6 (10 x 60%) and 40% of Player B's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> is 7 (18 x 40% = 7.2, rounded to 7) so the total is 13. Side A-B will receive 13 strokes.</p></div>

            <a id="9-5" name="9-5"></a>9-5. How To Decide Ties In Handicap Competitions</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>("The Rules of Golf," Appendix I)</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>For reference purposes, a "side" is a player, or two or more players who are partners. A side is considered synonymous with the term "team."</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Rule 33-6 empowers the Committee in charge of the competition to determine how and when a tie is decided. The decision should be published in advance.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The USGA recommends:</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
            <strong>(i) Match Play</strong>
            <br />A match that ends all square should be played off hole by hole until one side wins a hole. The playoff should start on the hole where the match began. In a handicap match, handicap strokes should be allowed as in the <em><a href="rule-14370.html#stipulatedround">stipulated round</a></em>.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
            <strong>(ii) Stroke Play</strong>
            <br />In the event of a tie in a handicap stroke play competition a play-off with handicaps is recommended. The playoff may be over 18 holes or a smaller number of holes as specified by the Committee. It is recommended that any such playoff consist of at least three holes.<br /><br />If the playoff is less than 18 holes and is a form of play where the stroke-hole allocation is not relevant, such as individual stroke play, the percentage of 18 holes to be played should be applied to the players' <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> for the playoff. Fractions of one-half stroke or more should count as a full stroke; any lesser fraction should be disregarded. <br /><br /><em>Example 1</em>: In an individual stroke play competition, A has a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of 10 and B a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of 7. If the Committee decides to conduct a nine-hole play-off (50 percent of 18 holes), A will deduct 5 strokes from his score B will deduct 4 from his score.<br /><br />If the playoff is less than 18 holes and is a form of play where the stroke-hole allocation is relevant, such as four-ball stroke play and Stableford, handicap strokes should be taken as they were assigned for the competition, using the players' respective stroke allocation tables. <br /><br /><em>Example 2: </em>In a four-ball stroke play competition, side A-B consists of A with a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of 10 and B with a <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> of 7 (after allowances). If the stroke hole allocation is assigned so that the odd stroke holes are allocated to the front nine and the even stroke holes are allocated to the back nine and the playoff is conducted over the back nine, A receives one stroke on the holes allocated 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 (for five total strokes) and B receives one stroke on the holes allocated 2, 4, and 6 (for three total strokes).</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
            <strong>(iii) Playoff Not Feasible; Matching Scorecards</strong>
            <br />If a playoff of any type is not feasible, matching scorecards is recommended. The method of matching cards should be announced in advance and should also provide what will happen if this procedure does not produce a winner. An acceptable method of matching cards is to determine the winner on the basis of the best score for the last nine holes. If the tying players have the same score for the last nine, determine the winner on the basis of the last six holes, last three holes and finally the 18th hole. If this method is used in a competition with a multiple tee start, it is recommended that the "last nine holes, last six holes, etc." is considered to be holes 10-18, 13-18, etc.<br /><br />For competitions where the stroke-hole allocation is not relevant, such as individual stroke play, if the last nine, last six, last three holes card matching is used, one-half, one-third, one-sixth, etc. of the <em><a href="rule-14370.html#CourseHandicap">Course Handicap</a></em> should be deducted from the score for those holes. Fractions of one-half stroke or more should count as a full stroke; any lesser fractions should be disregarded.</p></div>

          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>In competitions where the stroke hole allocation is relevant, such as four-ball stroke play, match play, match play vs. <em><a href="rule-14370.html#par">par</a></em> or bogey and Stableford, handicap strokes should be taken as they were assigned for the competition, using the players' respective stoke allocation tables.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
            <em>Example 4</em>: In a four-ball stroke play competition, if the Committee decides to match scorecards for the last nine holes, it would determine each side's score for the last nine holes using the lower partner's <em><a href="rule-14370.html#netscore">net scores</a></em> for each hole. This method results in a tie at 34. Side A-B has a score of 23 for the last six holes, C-D a score of 21, thus C-D win the match of score cards.</p></div>
