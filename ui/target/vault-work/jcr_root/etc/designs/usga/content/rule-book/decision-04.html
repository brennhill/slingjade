    <li>The shaft must be attached to the clubhead at the heel (Appendix <a href="rule-14323.html">II</a>, 2c);</li>

However, material attached to the clubhead that does not affect the performance of the club and is semi-permanent, durable, not easily removable and conforms to the shape of the clubhead may be permitted by exception, but an adhesive bandage or tape does not fall under that exception because such items are temporary in nature and easily removable.

Therefore, the separate clubhead and shaft do not count towards the number of clubs the player may carry under Rule <a href="rule-04.html#4-4a">4-4a</a>. However, regardless of the number of clubs carried, it is not permissible to assemble a clubhead and shaft carried by or for the player during the stipulated round. Consequently, if the player did replace or add a club by assembling components carried by or for him during the round, the player would be penalized under Rule <a href="rule-04.html#4-3a(iii)">4-3a(iii)</a> or Rule <a href="rule-04.html#4-4a">4-4a</a>, as applicable.</p></div>
