Moreover, the insert itself must extend to at least 0.84 inches (21.34 mm) on either side of the center line of the face and to within at least 0.2 inches (5.08 mm) of the top line and leading edge of the face.</span> </p></div>

            <strong>(ii) Impact Area Roughness</strong> </p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>When dealing with the surface roughness of a club face (not including putters, see Design of Clubs, Section 5f), the claims made by the manufacturer must be taken into account - especially if there is a claim that the roughness of the face influences the movement of the ball. In the absence of such claims, the ruling would be made purely on the amount of roughness in the impact area.<span style="COLOR: rgb(42,73,141)"> Sandblasting or other treatments of roughness greater than 180 micro inches are not permitted. In addition, for milling, the crest to trough depth must not exceed 0.001 inches (0.025 mm). A reasonable tolerance is allowed for both of these measurements. </span>Non-conforming sandblasting or milling usually feels rough to the touch.</p></div>

            <strong>(iii) Impact Area Material</strong> </p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The requirement that the whole of the "impact area" must be of the same material does not apply to clubs made of wood or putters (see Design of Clubs, Section 5f). The reason why it does not apply to wooden headed clubs is to allow the continued use of wooden clubs which have plastic inserts and brass screws in the center of the face. This design was commonly used in persimmon woods, which may still be in use. However, a club face or insert made of a composite material would be considered to be of a single material, and therefore would not be contrary to this rule.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
            <span style="COLOR: rgb(42,73,141)">Metal wood club faces which have inserts of different material, not trapezoidal in shape, may be permitted if the height of the insert meets the definition of "impact area" and the width of the insert is the same as the height in at least one point. However, in order to preserve the intent of the "same material" Rule, clubs which have unusually shaped inserts of different material (i.e., other than circular, oval, square or rectangular) are not normally permitted.</span> </p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
            <span style="COLOR: rgb(42,73,141)">If an insert of different material is permitted under the above guideline, the insert would be considered the "impact area" for that club. Therefore, any markings outside that area need not conform to the specifications provided in Appendix II, 5c. However, such markings must not be designed to unduly influence the movement of the ball.</span> </p></div>
