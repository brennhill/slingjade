  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>A player hit his tee shot deep into the woods on the right. The player then hit a provisional ball into the same woods. The player did not search for either ball.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">The player deemed his first ball unplayable, said he was abandoning his provisional ball and hit a third ball from the tee. The player maintained that his third ball was in play and that he was lying 3. He based his argument on Rule <a href="rule-28.html#28">28</a>, which states that the player is the sole judge as to whether his ball is unplayable, and on Decision <a href="decision-28.html#d28-1">28/1</a>, which says in effect that a player may proceed under the stroke-and-distance option of the unplayable ball Rule without finding his ball. The Committee ruled that the player's stroke with the third ball was his fifth stroke, but the wording of Decision 28/1 leaves a little doubt. Did the Committee rule correctly?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>Yes. The player may not deem the first ball from the tee unplayable, disregard the provisional ball and put another ball into play under a stroke-and-distance penalty because, having played the provisional ball, he must find the original ball before he can deem it unplayable. Unless the original ball was found, the provisional ball would automatically become the ball in play.</p></div>

Dropping behind under Rule <a href="rule-28.html#28b">28b</a> is impossible due to a boundary fence and dropping within two club-lengths under Rule <a href="rule-28.html#28c">28c</a> is not feasible because it would require a considerable number of such drops to escape the area.

  <h4 class="q_topic">Stray Ball Deemed Unplayable, Dropped Within Two Club-Lengths and Played Before Error Discovered</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>A player finds a stray ball, which he mistakenly thinks is his, in a bad lie. He deems it unplayable and decides to adopt the procedure in Rule <a href="rule-28.html#28c">28c</a>. He drops the stray ball within two club-lengths of the spot where it lay and plays it. He then finds his original ball in a playable position. In Decision <a href="decision-28.html#d28-14">28/14</a> the basic situation is exactly the same, but in that case the player elected to proceed under Rule <a href="rule-28.html#28a">28a</a> and it was ruled that the stray ball played under penalty of stroke and distance was in play. What is the ruling in this case?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>The procedures in Rules <a href="rule-28.html#28b">28b</a> and <a href="rule-28.html#28c">28c</a> may not be applied except with reference to the position of the player's ball in play, which must first be found and identified (see Decision <a href="decision-28.html#d28-1">28/1</a>). In the present case, the stray ball dropped and played by the player was not his original ball; it was a substituted ball. Since the location of the original ball was not known at the time the substituted ball was dropped, he was required to proceed under Rule <a href="rule-27.html#27-1">27-1</a>. As the substituted ball was not dropped at the spot required by Rule <a href="rule-27.html#27-1">27-1</a>, he played from a wrong place (see Decision <a href="decision-15.html#d15-14">15/14</a>).</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">In match play, he incurred a penalty of loss of hole (Rule <a href="rule-20.html#20-7b">20-7b</a>).</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">In stroke play, he incurred a penalty of one stroke under Rule <a href="rule-27.html#27-1">27-1</a> and an additional penalty of two strokes under Rule <a href="rule-20.html#20-7c">20-7c</a> for playing from a wrong place. If the breach was a serious one, he was subject to disqualification unless he corrected the error as provided in Rule <a href="rule-20.html#20-7c">20-7c</a>.</p></div>
