The player is entitled to act on such information in his subsequent play. Consequently, the Committee may be required to make a judgment as to both the duration of the player's entitlement and his proper score when, as a result of proceeding according to the incorrect information provided by the official, he is liable to a penalty under the Rules.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">In these situations, the Committee should resolve the matter in whatever manner it considers most equitable, in light of all the facts and with the objective of ensuring that no player receives an undue advantage or disadvantage. In cases where the incorrect information significantly affects the results of the competition, the Committee may have no option but to cancel the round. The following principles, in equity (Rule <a href="rule-01.html#1-4">1-4</a>), are applicable:</p></div>

The Committee has the authority to extend this exemption for the duration of the round in circumstances where the player proceeds incorrectly on his own in exactly the same manner as advised by a referee earlier in the round. However, that exemption would cease if, in that round, the player becomes aware of the proper procedure or has his actions questioned.</p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic_sub">When a member of the Committee or a referee gives incorrect information on whether a Local Rule or condition of the competition is in effect, the player should be exempt from penalty for acting on that information.

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic_sub">When a member of the Committee or a referee rules that a non-conforming club is conforming, the player should be exempt from penalty for carrying or using the club.

    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>As the ball moved after the player had addressed it, he was required to replace the ball with a penalty stroke under Rule <a href="rule-18.html#18-2b">18-2b</a>. When he failed to do so, he played from a wrong place and loses the hole in match play or incurs a penalty of two strokes in stroke play under Rule <a href="rule-18.html#18">18</a>.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">The player must continue with the ball played from the wrong place except that, in stroke play, if a serious breach is involved and the player has not yet played from the next teeing ground or, in the case of the last hole of the round, before the player leaves the putting green, the referee must require the player to cancel the stroke made with the ball from the wrong place and any subsequent strokes and play from the original location of the ball.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">The imposition of the general penalty in this situation is different from the ruling in Decision <a href="decision-34.html#d34-3-7">34-3/7</a> in that, in this case, the player provided the incorrect information that led to the incorrect ruling. The player is responsible for providing the correct facts to the referee and is subject to penalty under the applicable Rule if his incorrect version of the facts led to his playing from a wrong place.</p></div>

  <h4 class="q_topic">Resolution of Questions of Fact; Referee and Committee Responsibility</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">Resolving questions of fact is among the most difficult actions required of a referee, or the Committee as a whole. For example, these situations include a broad array of incidents such as determining whether a player caused a ball to move (Decisions <a href="decision-18.html#d18-10">18/10</a>, <a href="decision-18.html#d18-2a-30">18-2a/30</a> and <a href="decision-18.html#d18-2a-30.5">18-2a/30.5</a>), whether a player played from outside the teeing ground (Decision <a href="decision-34.html#d34-3-4">34-3/4</a>), whether a stroke was made (Decision <a href="decision-14.html#d14-1.5">14/1.5</a>), the hole at which a wrong ball was played (Decision <a href="decision-15.html#d15-1-3">15-1/3</a>) and the state of a match (Decision <a href="decision-34.html#d34-3-5">34-3/5</a>).</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">In all situations involving questions of fact, resolution of the doubt must be made in light of all the relevant circumstances and evaluation of the weight of the evidence, including the balance of probabilities where applicable (Decision <a href="decision-15.html#d15-1-3">15-1/3</a>). When the Committee is unable to determine the facts to its satisfaction, it must resolve the matter in the fairest way (Decision <a href="decision-34.html#d34-3-5">34-3/5</a>).</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">Testimony of the players involved is important and must be given due consideration. In some situations where the facts are not decisive, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the player (Decisions <a href="decision-15.html#d15-1-2">15-1/2</a> and <a href="decision-19.html#d19-1-4.1">19-1/4.1</a>); in others, the doubt should be resolved against the player (Decision <a href="decision-13.html#d13-4-35.5">13-4/35.5</a> and <a href="decision-21.html#d21-3">21/3</a>). There is no hard-and-fast rule for evaluating the testimony of the players or for assigning the weight to be given to such testimony and each situation must be treated on its own merits. The proper action depends on the circumstances in each case and must be left to the judgment of the referee, or the Committee as a whole.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">Testimony of those who are not a part of the competition, including spectators, must be accepted and evaluated (Decision <a href="decision-27.html#d27-12">27/12</a>). It is also appropriate to use television footage and the like to assist in resolving doubt.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">It is important that any questions of fact be resolved in a timely manner such that the competition may proceed in an orderly way. Thus, the referee may be limited to evaluating the evidence available to him in a timely manner. Any such ruling is always subject to further review by the referee, or Committee as a whole as additional evidence becomes available.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">If a judgment is made by a referee, the player is entitled to proceed on the basis of that ruling whether it is an interpretation of the Rules of Golf (Decision <a href="decision-34.html#d34-3-1.5">34-3/1.5</a>) or a resolution of a question of fact (Decision <a href="decision-34.html#d34-3-7">34-3/7</a>). In situations arising in both circumstances, if the ruling is found to be incorrect, the Committee may have the authority to make a correction (Decisions <a href="decision-34.html#d34-3-1">34-3/1</a> and <a href="decision-34.html#d34-3-7">34-3/7</a>). However, in all circumstances, including both match play and stroke play, the referee or Committee is limited in its ability to make corrections by the guidance contained in Decisions <a href="decision-34.html#d34-2-5">34-2/5</a>, <a href="decision-34.html#d34-2-6">34-2/6</a>, <a href="decision-34.html#d34-2-7">34-2/7</a>, <a href="decision-34.html#d34-3-3">34-3/3</a> and <a href="decision-34.html#d34-3-3.3">34-3/3.3</a>.</p></div>

  <h4 class="q_topic">Course Record</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">The term "course record" is not defined in the Rules of Golf. However, it is generally accepted that a record score should be recognized as the official "course record" only if made in an individual stroke-play competition (excluding bogey, par or Stableford competitions) with the holes and tee-markers in their proper medal or championship positions.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">It is recommended that a record score should not be recognized as the official "course record" if a Local Rule permitting preferred lies is in operation.</p></div>

  <h4 class="q_topic">Whether Rakes Should Be Placed in or Outside Bunkers</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>Should rakes be placed in or outside bunkers?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>There is not a perfect answer for the position of rakes, but on balance it is felt there is less likelihood of an advantage or disadvantage to the player if rakes are placed outside bunkers.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">It may be argued that there is more likelihood of a ball being deflected into or kept out of a bunker if the rake is placed outside the bunker. It could also be argued that if the rake is in the bunker it is most unlikely that the ball will be deflected out of the bunker.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">However, in practice, players who leave rakes in bunkers frequently leave them at the side which tends to stop a ball rolling into the flat part of the bunker, resulting in a much more difficult shot than would otherwise have been the case. This is most prevalent at a course where the bunkers are small. When the ball comes to rest on or against a rake in the bunker and the player must proceed under Rule <a href="rule-24.html#24-1">24-1</a>, it may not be possible to replace the ball on the same spot or find a spot in the bunker which is not nearer the hole - see Decision <a href="decision-20.html#d20-3d-2">20-3d/2</a>.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">If rakes are left in the middle of the bunker the only way to position them is to throw them into the bunker and this causes damage to the surface. Also, if a rake is in the middle of a large bunker it is either not used or the player is obliged to rake a large area of the bunker resulting in unnecessary delay.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">Therefore, after considering all these aspects, it is recommended that rakes should be left outside bunkers in areas where they are least likely to affect the movement of the ball.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">Ultimately, it is a matter for the Committee to decide where it wishes rakes to be placed.</p></div>
