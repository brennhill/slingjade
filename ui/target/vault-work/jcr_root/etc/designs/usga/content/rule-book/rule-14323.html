  <h2 class="sectionhead">Appendix II - Design of Clubs </h2>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>A player in doubt as to the conformity of a club should consult the USGA. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>A manufacturer should submit to the USGA a sample of a club to be manufactured for a ruling as to whether the club conforms with the <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Rule-Or-Rules">Rules</a></em>. The sample becomes the property of the USGA for reference purposes. If a manufacturer fails to submit a sample or, having submitted a sample, fails to await a ruling before manufacturing and/or marketing the club, the manufacturer assumes the risk of a ruling that the club does not conform with the <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Rule-Or-Rules">Rules</a></em>. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The following paragraphs prescribe general regulations for the design of clubs, together with specifications and interpretations. Further information relating to these regulations and their proper interpretation is provided in "A Guide to the Rules on Clubs and Balls." </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Where a club, or part of a club, is required to meet a specification within the <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Rule-Or-Rules">Rules</a></em>, it must be designed and manufactured with the intention of meeting that specification. </p></div>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">1. Clubs </h3>
  <h4 class="letterhead">a. General </h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>A club is an implement designed to be used for striking the ball and generally comes in three forms: woods, irons and putters distinguished by shape and intended use. A putter is a club with a loft not exceeding ten degrees designed primarily for use on the <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Putting-Green">putting green</a></em>. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The club must not be substantially different from the traditional and customary form and make. The club must be composed of a shaft and a head and it may also have material added to the shaft to enable the player to obtain a firm hold (see 3 below). All parts of the club must be fixed so that the club is one unit, and it must have no external attachments. Exceptions may be made for attachments that do not affect the performance of the club. </p></div>
  <h4 class="letterhead">b. Adjustability </h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>All clubs may incorporate features for weight adjustment. Other forms of adjustability may also be permitted upon evaluation by the USGA. The following requirements apply to all permissible methods of adjustment: </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>(i) the adjustment cannot be readily made; </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>(ii) all adjustable parts are firmly fixed and there is no reasonable likelihood of them working loose during a round; and </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>(iii) all configurations of adjustment conform with the <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Rule-Or-Rules">Rules</a></em>. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>During a <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Stipulated-Round">stipulated round</a></em>, the playing characteristics of a club must not be purposely changed by adjustment or by any other means (see Rule <a href="rule-04.html#4-2a">4-2a</a>). </p></div>
  <h4 class="letterhead">c. Length </h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The overall length of the club must be at least 18 inches (0.457 m) and, except for putters, must not exceed 48 inches (1.219 m). </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="imageline">
    <img src="./img/FigI.jpg" />
  </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>For woods and irons, the measurement of length is taken when the club is lying on a horizontal plane and the sole is set against a 60 degree plane as shown in Fig. I. The length is defined as the distance from the point of the intersection between the two planes to the top of the grip. For putters, the measurement of length is taken from the top of the grip along the axis of the shaft or a straight line extension of it to the sole of the club. </p></div>
  <h4 class="letterhead">d. Alignment </h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>When the club is in its normal address position the shaft must be so aligned that: </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>(i) the projection of the straight part of the shaft on to the vertical plane through the toe and heel must diverge from the vertical by at least 10 degrees (see Fig. II). If the overall design of the club is such that the player can effectively use the club in a vertical or close-to-vertical position, the shaft may be required to diverge from the vertical in this plane by as much as 25 degrees; </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>(ii) the projection of the straight part of the shaft on to the vertical plane along the intended <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Line-Of-Play">line of play</a></em> must not diverge from the vertical by more than 20 degrees forwards or 10 degrees backwards (see Fig. III). </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="image_anchor">
    <img src="./img/FigII.jpg" />
  </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="image_anchor">
    <img src="./img/FigIII.jpg" />
  </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Except for putters, all of the heel portion of the club must lie within 0.625 inches (15.88 mm) of the plane containing the axis of the straight part of the shaft and the intended (horizontal) <em><a href="rule-14253.html#Line-Of-Play">line of play</a></em> (see Fig. IV). </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="image_anchor">
    <img src="./img/FigIV.jpg" />
  </p></div>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">2. Shaft </h3>
  <h4 class="letterhead">a. Straightness </h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The shaft must be straight from the top of the grip to a point not more than 5 inches (127 mm) above the sole, measured from the point where the shaft ceases to be straight along the axis of the bent part of the shaft and the neck and/or socket (see Fig. V). </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="image_anchor">
    <img src="./img/FigV.jpg" />
  </p></div>
  <h4 class="letterhead">b. Bending and Twisting Properties </h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>At any point along its length, the shaft must: </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>(i) bend in such a way that the deflection is the same regardless of how the shaft is rotated about its longitudinal axis; and </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>(ii) twist the same amount in both directions. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p> </p></div>
  <h4 class="letterhead">c. Attachment to Clubhead </h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The shaft must be attached to the clubhead at the heel either directly or through a single plain neck and/or socket. The length from the top of the neck and/or socket to the sole of the club must not exceed 5 inches (127 mm), measured along the axis of, and following any bend in, the neck and/or socket (see Fig. VI).</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="image_anchor">
    <img src="./img/FigVI.jpg" />
  </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
    <strong>Exception for Putters:</strong> The shaft or neck or socket of a putter may be fixed at any point in the head. </p></div>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">3. Grip (see Fig. VII) </h3>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The grip consists of material added to the shaft to enable the player to obtain a firm hold. The grip must be fixed to the shaft, must be straight and plain in form, must extend to the end of the shaft and must not be molded for any part of the hands. If no material is added, that portion of the shaft designed to be held by the player must be considered the grip. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="image_anchor">
    <img src="./img/FigVII.jpg" />
  </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>(i) For clubs other than putters the grip must be circular in cross-section, except that a continuous, straight, slightly raised rib may be incorporated along the full length of the grip, and a slightly indented spiral is permitted on a wrapped grip or a replica of one. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>(ii) A putter grip may have a non-circular cross-section, provided the cross-section has no concavity, is symmetrical and remains generally similar throughout the length of the grip. (See Clause (v) overleaf). </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>(iii) The grip may be tapered but must not have any bulge or waist. Its cross-sectional dimensions measured in any direction must not exceed 1.75 inches (44.45 mm). </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>(iv) For clubs other than putters the axis of the grip must coincide with the axis of the shaft. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>(v) A putter may have two grips provided each is circular in cross-section, the axis of each coincides with the axis of the shaft, and they are separated by at least 1.5 inches (38.1 mm). </p></div>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">4. Clubhead </h3>
  <h4 class="letterhead">a. Plain in Shape </h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The clubhead must be generally plain in shape. All parts must be rigid, structural in nature and functional. The clubhead or its parts must not be designed to resemble any other object. It is not practicable to define plain in shape precisely and comprehensively. However, features that are deemed to be in breach of this requirement and are therefore not permitted include, but are not limited to: </p></div>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">(i) All Clubs </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>holes through the face; </li>
    <li>holes through the head (some exceptions may be made for putters and cavity back irons); </li>
    <li>facsimiles of golf balls or actual golf balls incorporated into the head; </li>
    <li>features that are for the purpose of meeting dimensional specifications; </li>
    <li>features that extend into or ahead of the face; </li>
    <li>features that extend significantly above the top line of the head; </li>
    <li>furrows in or runners on the head that extend into the face (some exceptions may be made for putters); and </li>
    <li>optical or electronic devices. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">(ii) Woods and Irons </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>all features listed in (i) above; </li>
    <li>cavities in the outline of the heel and/or the toe of the head that can be viewed from above; </li>
    <li>severe or multiple cavities in the outline of the back of the head that can be viewed from above; </li>
    <li>transparent material added to the head with the intention of rendering conforming a feature that is not otherwise permitted; and </li>
    <li>features that extend beyond the outline of the head when viewed from above. </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="letterhead">b. Dimensions, Volume and Moment of Inertia </h4>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">(i) Woods </h3>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>When the club is in a 60 degree lie angle, the dimensions of the clubhead must be such that: </p></div>
  <ul>
    <li>the distance from the heel to the toe of the clubhead is greater than the distance from the face to the back; </li>
    <li>the distance from the heel to the toe of the clubhead is not greater than 5 inches (127 mm); and </li>
    <li>the distance from the sole to the crown of the clubhead, including any permitted features, is not greater than 2.8 inches (71.12 mm). </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>These dimensions are measured on horizontal lines between vertical projections of the outermost points of: </p></div>
  <ul>
    <li>the heel and the toe; and </li>
    <li>the face and the back (see Fig. VIII, dimension A); </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>and on vertical lines between the horizontal projections of the outermost points of the sole and the crown (see Fig. VIII, dimension B). If the outermost point of the heel is not clearly defined, it is deemed to be 0.875 inches (22.23 mm) above the horizontal plane on which the club is lying (see Fig. VIII, dimension C). </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="image_anchor">
    <img src="./img/FigVIII.jpg" />
  </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The volume of the clubhead must not exceed 460 cubic centimeters (28.06 cubic inches), plus a tolerance of 10 cubic centimeters (0.61 cubic inches). </p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>(iii) unduly influence the movement of the ball. </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> (i) above does not apply to putters. </p></div>
  <h4 class="letterhead">d. Striking Faces </h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The clubhead must have only one striking face, except that a putter may have two such faces if their characteristics are the same, and they are opposite each other. </p></div>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">5. Club Face </h3>
  <h4 class="letterhead">a. General </h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The face of the club must be hard and rigid and must not impart significantly more or less spin to the ball than a standard steel face (some exceptions may be made for putters). Except for such markings listed below, the club face must be smooth and must not have any degree of concavity.</p></div>
  <h4 class="letterhead">b. Impact Area Roughness and Material </h4>
