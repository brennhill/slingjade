          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The "plain in shape" requirement in Appendix II, 4a originates from the "traditional and customary" requirement in Appendix II, 1a. It is generally a descriptive rule, although in reality, it is challenging to define exactly what a golf club can or should look like. The following section assists in explaining what is and what is not permitted, but it should be noted that this is not an all-inclusive list. <span style="COLOR: rgb(42,73,141)">Even if a clubhead satisfies all of the points outlined below, there may still be features or characteristics which render it not generally plain in shape. An overall assessment of the appearance of the head should always be made.</span> </p></div>

            </tbody>
          </table>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>This provision basically means that the design of the clubhead must be free from gimmicks (though putters are viewed more liberally than woods and irons), must have the general appearance of a clubhead, must not have the appearance of another object, or incorporate certain features which are designed to resemble another object (see Figure 16). All parts of the head must be rigid throughout their length, including permanent, permissible appendages. <span style="COLOR: rgb(42,73,141)">As a general guideline, "rigid" means that it must not be possible to bend or flex any part of the clubhead by hand (see Figure 17).</span> </p></div>

          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Rule 4a, Appendix II acknowledges that defining whether a clubhead is "plain in shape" is not easy. However, the USGA modified the wording in 2008 to help better define what is intended by this Rule. The Rule now reflects the more liberalized application for putters, which has evolved over the years and provides more detail regarding what is and is not permitted for iron heads and woodheads.</p></div>

            <li>Holes through the head are not permitted for iron heads.

          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>This Rule was introduced in 2004 due to the trend of increasing driver head sizes. The Equipment Standards Committee determined that woodheads larger than those already permitted were not traditional and customary. Many woodheads in the marketplace incorporate markings on the sole or other part of the head to indicate approximate volume. However, there is a fairly simple method of measuring clubhead volume, which is based on the displacement of water. By submerging a clubhead in a large measuring container, partially filled with water, the amount that the water rises indicates the head's volume.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>A more accurate method, but not that much more complicated, is the use of a similar container of water placed on a digital weighing scale. With either method, the head is submerged to a point just above the crown (i.e., the hosel is not included).</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Archimedes' Principle states that the buoyant force on a submerged object is equal to the weight of the fluid that is displaced by the object - and since water has a specific gravity of 1.0, this means that 1 cubic centimeter of water has a mass of 1 gram. Therefore, the container of water should be placed on the scale and the weight should be set to zero. When the head is submerged in the water, the weight displayed on the scale (in grams) is equivalent to the volume of the head (in cubic centimeters).</p></div>

          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>In situations where a club is marked with a "cc" value which is in excess of the Rule (i.e., above 460 cubic centimeters), the Committee's policy is to rule that the club is non-conforming - regardless of the actual volume measurement. This is to avoid confusion in the marketplace.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Prior to measuring the volume of a clubhead, the head should be inspected for cavities. All cavities on the crown should be filled with waterproof clay or other similar material using a straight-line method which connects the edges of the cavity. The straight-line method does not follow the taper or curvature of the surface of the head, rather the cavity is filled so that it becomes a flat surface which adjoins the outer edges.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Only significant cavities in the sole will be filled. We define significant as <span style="COLOR: rgb(42,73,141)">any cavity or series of cavities which have a collective volume of greater than 15cc.</span> </p></div>

          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The measurement of MOI is one of only a few limits within the Rules which cannot be easily performed in the field. This is because the MOI measurement requires specialized equipment and the head must be removed from the shaft. However, drivers with higher MOI measurements are generally represented by models manufactured in recent years and, as a result, have been routinely submitted to the USGA or R&amp;A due to the publication of the List of Conforming Driver Heads.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The MOI of a driver head is directly related to the head's weight, as well as to the distribution of the head's weight. As a result, a driver head which is designed to be adjustable for weight must conform to the Rules in all available configurations (see Design of Clubs, Section 1b). Additionally, a player who adds additional weight to the driver head, such as with the addition of lead tape, must be certain that the driver head still conforms to the Rules (see Rule 4-1b). To assist golfers with this determination, the Committee will notify a manufacturer that has submitted a driver head having an MOI which is close to the limit, to advise its customers that the addition of any weights to that particular head, including lead tape, other than the weights supplied by the manufacturer for that particular head, is not permitted as it would likely render the club non-conforming.</p></div>

          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Effective January 1, 2008, the USGA re-worded and re-positioned the spring effect clause previously found under Rule 5a, Appendix II to this section of the Rules. Among other things, the language codified the underlying principles of several decisions made by the USGA over the past several years regarding spring design features. Rule 4c, Appendix II now states:</p></div>

            </tbody>
          </table>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Because "spring effect" is purely a performance-related limit which cannot be easily measured in the field without specialized equipment and cannot be assessed through visual inspection of the clubhead, the USGA compiles and maintains a List of Conforming Driver Heads. The List is updated on a weekly basis and can be accessed through the USGA's Web site (<em>www.usga.org</em>). Additionally, features in the clubhead design that are intended to or have the effect of unduly influencing the clubhead's spring effect are not permitted. The USGA has adopted an interim test method to assist in streamlining evaluation of these types of designs and, as a result, if the spring effect of the clubhead, measured at any point on the face, does not exceed the limit set forth in the Pendulum Test Protocol on file, the clubhead would likely conform to this provision.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>For competitions involving expert players, the USGA recommends that the Committee in charge of the competition adopt the List of Conforming Driver Heads as a Condition of Competition (See Appendix I, Part C, Section 1a). The Condition requires that any driver a player carries must have a clubhead, identified by model and loft, that is named on the current List of Conforming Driver Heads issued by the USGA. It is important to note that a driver with a clubhead manufactured prior to 1999 is exempt from the requirement of the condition.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>While this Condition is not recommended for use by other competition committees, the Rules regarding club conformance, including spring effect, apply to all rounds conducted under USGA Rules of Golf, including those rounds played for the purpose of posting a handicap score.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Finally, if a manufacturer makes claims of spring-like features or that a clubhead, other than a putter, exceeds the Pendulum Test limit, or if there is strong evidence to suggest that the club, in fact, exceeds the limit, then the club will be considered non-conforming to this Rule.</p></div>
