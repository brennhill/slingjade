  <h4 class="q_topic">Examples of Rulings in Four-Ball Stroke Play with Concurrent Individual Competition</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">When competitors are involved in concurrent stroke-play competitions, whenever possible the Rules are applied only to the competition affected. When it is not possible to separate the competitions, the four-ball competition takes precedence. The exception to that is with Rule <a href="rule-08.html#8-1">8-1</a> (Advice), as the two partners may not exchange advice if both are playing in the individual competition; if just one of them is playing in the individual competition, they may exchange advice.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">A and B are partners in four-ball stroke play, and they are concurrently playing in an individual stroke-play competition. The following are examples of the application of the Rules in such a format:</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic">(1)	B moves A's ball without authority under the Rules. In the four-ball competition A incurs a penalty stroke (Rule <a href="rule-18.html#18-2a">18-2a</a>), but he incurs no penalty in the individual competition. B incurs no penalty in either competition.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic">(2)	On the 3rd hole it is discovered that B started his round with 15 clubs. In the four-ball competition Side A-B incurs a total penalty of four strokes (two strokes on each of the first two holes), but A incurs no penalty in the individual competition. B incurs a total penalty of four strokes in the individual competition.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic">(3)	During the round B makes a stroke at a non-conforming ball. In the four-ball competition Side A-B is disqualified (Rules <a href="rule-05.html#5-1">5-1</a> and <a href="rule-31.html#31-7a">31-7a</a>), but A incurs no penalty in the individual competition. B is disqualified from the individual competition.</p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>D was late for his starting time and as such, D may play the first hole, adding the penalty of two strokes prescribed by Rule <a href="rule-06.html#6-3a">6-3a</a> to his score for that hole. Rule <a href="rule-31.html#31-2">31-2</a> allows an absent player to join his partner before his partner has commenced play of a hole. As C had not yet played from the teeing ground, D may join him.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">If D did not arrive until later in the round, he would be able to join his partner between holes without penalty, provided C had not yet played from the next tee, regardless of whether A and/or B had played.</p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>In four-ball stroke play on a handicap basis, partners A and B both holed out in 4 at the 8th hole; partner A did not receive a handicap stroke at the hole, but partner B did. The marker, who was a fellow-competitor, recorded a gross score of 4 for A, who did not receive a stroke, and no gross score for B. However, the marker also recorded a net 3 in the better-ball column.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">On completion of the round, the score card, in all other respects correct, was signed and returned to the Committee. Both the marker and the partners were interviewed, and it was established that in fact both partners had gross scores of 4 at the 8th hole. What is the ruling?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>Under Rules <a href="rule-06.html#6-6b">6-6b</a> and <a href="rule-31.html#31-3">31-3</a>, it was the responsibility of one of the partners to check the side's better-ball gross score for each hole before signing the score card.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">When checking the score card, the partner concerned should have noticed that there was no gross score recorded for B at the 8th hole and should have corrected this mistake. As he did not do so, A's gross 4 was the side's score for the hole. It is the responsibility of the Committee - and not the competitor - to record the better-ball net score for each hole.</p></div>
