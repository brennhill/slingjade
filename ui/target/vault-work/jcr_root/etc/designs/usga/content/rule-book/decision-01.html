In many cases in match play (e.g., a player who intentionally stops his ball from entering a water hazard), a penalty of loss of hole is sufficient while in stroke play the player should be disqualified for a serious breach. In some cases (e.g., the purposeful act of damaging the line of putt referred to in Decision <a href="decision-01.html#d1-2-1">1-2/1</a>), a penalty of disqualification in match play may be appropriate.</p></div>

    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>What is the meaning of the phrase "sole purpose of caring for the course" in Exception 2 to Rule <a href="rule-01.html#1-2">1-2</a>?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>The phrase "sole purpose of caring for the course" in the Exception refers to the performance of acts that are encouraged in the Etiquette Section of the Rules of Golf provided they are taken at the appropriate time and in a manner permitted by the Rules. The provisions of Rule <a href="rule-01.html#1-2">1-2</a> do not prevent a player from taking acts that conform with the Etiquette Section, so long as the player does so for the sole purpose of caring for the course and without intentionally influencing the movement of a ball, or the physical conditions affecting play, of a player in the player's group or match. For example, while a player may not smooth the ragged edge of a hole or tap down spike marks in order to influence the movement of a ball of an opponent, fellow-competitor or partner, the player may generally smooth the ragged edge of a hole or tap down spike marks as a courtesy to players in following groups or matches, or for care of the course (see Decision <a href="decision-01.html#d1-2-3.5">1-2/3.5</a>). Similarly, while a player may not press down a piece of turf in the area in which a ball in motion may come to rest or in the area in which a ball is to be dropped or placed with the intention of influencing the movement of the ball, a player generally may attempt to tidy up the course by repairing divot holes and/or replacing divots that do not affect play of the hole by a player in the player's group or match (see Decision <a href="decision-01.html#d1-2-8">1-2/8</a>).</p></div>

  <h4 class="q_topic">Player Breaches Rules More Than Once; Whether Multiple Penalties Should Be Applied</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">Situations arise prior to or as a result of a stroke in which a player breaches a single Rule more than once, or breaches separate Rules, in a single act or in different but sequential acts. The question arises whether it is appropriate to apply a penalty to each separate breach.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">The Rules expressly provide that multiple penalties are not to be applied in certain situations (e.g., Rules <a href="rule-15.html#15-2">15-2</a>, <a href="rule-18.html#18">18</a>, <a href="rule-20.html#20-7">20-7</a> and <a href="rule-21.html#21">21</a>). However, there are many other situations where multiple breaches of the Rules may occur and the Rules themselves do not expressly specify whether a penalty should be applied to each separate breach. In such cases, equity (Rule <a href="rule-01.html#1-4">1-4</a>) applies, and the following principles should be used:</p></div>
  <h4 class="q_text_arabic_bd">1.	One Act Results in One Rule Being Breached More Than Once - Single Penalty Applied</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_indented">Example: In stroke play, a competitor's ball on the putting green strikes a fellow-competitor's ball in breach of Rule <a href="rule-19.html#19-5a">19-5a</a> and then strikes another fellow-competitor's ball, also in breach of Rule <a href="rule-19.html#19-5a">19-5a</a>. The ruling would be a single two-stroke penalty.</p></div>
  <h4 class="q_text_arabic_bd">2.	One Act Results in Two Rules Being Breached - Single Penalty Applied</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_indented">Example: In stroke play, a competitor is considering putting his ball from a bunker and rakes a footprint in the bunker on his line of play. Both Rule <a href="rule-13.html#13-2">13-2</a> and Rule <a href="rule-13.html#13-4a">13-4a</a> have been breached. The ruling would be a single two-stroke penalty.</p></div>
  <h4 class="q_text_arabic_bd">3.	Related Acts Result in One Rule Being Breached More Than Once - Single Penalty Applied</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_indented">Example 1: In stroke play, a competitor takes several practice swings in a hazard, touching the ground each time. The practice swings are related acts breaching a single Rule. The ruling would be a single two-stroke penalty under Rule <a href="rule-13.html#13-4b">13-4b</a> (see Decision <a href="decision-13.html#d13-4-3">13-4/3</a> but also see Principle 6 Example 3).</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_indented">Example 2: A and B are fellow-competitors playing a par three hole. B is to play first and A asks B whether it is best to play for the center of the green or to play for the flagstick and B advises that it is best to play for the center of the green. A then asks what club B is going to use. B says he will hit a six iron. After B's stroke, which fell short of the green, A asks B if he had hit it well and B confirms that he did. A then hit his shot. The ruling is that both competitors incur a single two-stroke penalty under Rule <a href="rule-08.html#8-1">8-1</a> for seeking or giving three related pieces of information all of which might assist A in his choice of club for his next stroke and the way to play it (But see also Principle 6 Example 2).</p></div>
  <h4 class="q_text_arabic_bd">4.	Related Acts Result in Two Rules Being Breached - Single Penalty Applied</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_indented">Example 1: In stroke play, a competitor is considering putting his ball from a bunker and rakes several footprints in the bunker on his line of play. Both Rule <a href="rule-13.html#13-2">13-2</a> and Rule <a href="rule-13.html#13-4a">13-4a</a> have been breached multiple times by related acts. The ruling would be a single two-stroke penalty.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_indented">Example 2: In stroke play, a competitor's ball moves prior to address and, while it is in motion, it is accidentally stopped by the competitor's club in breach of Rule <a href="rule-19.html#19-2">19-2</a> and comes to rest against it. The competitor then moves the club, as a result of which his ball moves - a breach of Rule <a href="rule-18.html#18-2a">18-2a</a>. These related acts would result in a single one-stroke penalty (see Decision <a href="decision-19.html#d19-2-1.5">19-2/1.5</a>).</p></div>
  <h4 class="q_text_arabic_bd">5.	Unrelated Acts Result in Two Rules Being Breached - Multiple Penalties Applied</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_indented">Example 1: In stroke play, a competitor (1) touches the ground in a hazard with his club while taking practice swings in a hazard and (2) improves his line of play by bending a shrub with his hand. The ruling would be a two-stroke penalty under Rule <a href="rule-13.html#13-4">13-4</a> (touching the ground in a hazard with his club) and a further penalty of two strokes under Rule <a href="rule-13.html#13-2">13-2</a> (for the unrelated act of improving his line of play by moving something growing), giving a total penalty of four strokes (see Decision <a href="decision-13.html#d13-4-28">13-4/28</a>).</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_indented">Example 2: Under Example 2 in Principle 4 above, if the ball is not replaced before the competitor makes his next stroke, the failure to replace the ball is an unrelated act and the competitor incurs an additional penalty of two strokes under Rule <a href="rule-18.html#18-2a">18-2a</a>.</p></div>
  <h4 class="q_text_arabic_bd">6. 	Unrelated Acts Result in One Rule Being Breached More Than Once - Multiple Penalties Applied</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_indented">Example 1: In stroke play, a competitor (1) purposely steps on another player's line of putt with the intention of improving the line, and then (2) purposely stops his own ball in motion after it began moving without apparent cause before address. As the two acts were unrelated, the ruling would be two separate penalties, each of two strokes, for breaches of Rule <a href="rule-01.html#1-2">1-2</a>, giving a total penalty of four strokes.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_indented">Example 2: A and B are fellow-competitors waiting for the green to clear at a par three hole. A, who has been hitting all his iron shots right of target, asks B if his (A's) alignment has been wrong. B confirms that A's alignment has been wrong. After the green clears A asks B what club B is going to play. B does not answer. The ruling would be that A and B both incur a two-stroke penalty for asking for and giving advice about A's alignment (advice on the method of making a stroke). A incurs an additional two-stroke penalty for asking for information from B, which might assist A with his choice of club. Although both requests by A are breaches of the same Rule (Rule <a href="rule-08.html#8-1">8-1</a>) their character is sufficiently different to warrant two separate penalties.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_indented">Example 3: Under Example 1 in Principle 3 above, the competitor then makes a stroke and fails to get the ball out of the hazard. He makes two more practice swings in the hazard, again touching the ground each time. The ruling would be two separate two-stroke penalties under Rule <a href="rule-13.html#13-4b">13-4b</a>. The link between the acts was broken by the competitor's intervening stroke (see also Decision <a href="decision-01.html#d1-4-14">1-4/14</a>).</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">For the purposes of this Decision:</p></div>
