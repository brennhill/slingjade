    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>A player's ball lies on an immovable obstruction when play is suspended by the Committee. After the Committee orders a resumption of play and before the player makes a stroke, he takes relief from the obstruction under Rule <a href="rule-24.html#24-2b">24-2b</a>.

When the player discontinued play under Rule <a href="rule-06.html#6-8a">6-8a</a>, he was entitled to lift his ball without penalty under Rule <a href="rule-06.html#6-8c">6-8c</a>. When he resumed play under Rule <a href="rule-06.html#6-8d">6-8d</a>, he was entitled to follow the provisions of that Rule, despite the fact that he initially proceeded under Rule <a href="rule-24.html#24-2b">24-2b</a> after the Committee ordered a resumption of play. Resuming play in the context of Rule <a href="rule-06.html#6-8d">6-8d</a> means making a stroke and, therefore, Rule <a href="rule-06.html#6-8d(ii)">6-8d(ii)</a> applies to the player's situation. It is not the intent of the Rules to limit the player's options under Rule <a href="rule-06.html#6-8d(ii)">6-8d(ii)</a> simply because he did not take relief until the Committee ordered a resumption of play (see analogous Decision <a href="decision-06.html#d6-8b-8">6-8b/8</a>).</p></div>

  <h4 class="q_topic">Ball in Bad Lie in Rough Moved by Outside Agency During Suspension of Play; Player Fails to Estimate Position Sufficiently</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>A player finds his ball in deep rough and the ball is barely visible. Before the player makes a stroke, the Committee suspends play, and the player discontinues play immediately without lifting his ball. During the suspension of play, an outside agency moves the player's ball. The player is made aware of the outside agency's actions and, on the resumption of play, the player estimates the spot where the ball originally lay and places a ball on that spot. However, the ball is placed on top of the grass in a much better lie than prior to the suspension of play. What is the ruling?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>The Note to Rule <a href="rule-06.html#6-8d">6-8d</a> requires the player to estimate the spot where the ball is to be placed and to place the ball on the estimated spot. If the player places his ball in a lie that is significantly different from the original lie, the player has not estimated the position of the ball with sufficient accuracy. By placing the ball on top of the grass, the player placed the ball in the wrong place. If he makes a stroke from that spot without first correcting his error under Rule <a href="rule-20.html#20-6">20-6</a>, he would be subject to penalty under Rule <a href="rule-20.html#20-7">20-7</a> for playing from a wrong place.</p></div>
