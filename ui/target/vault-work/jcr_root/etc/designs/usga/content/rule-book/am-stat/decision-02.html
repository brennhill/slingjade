He may make general inquiries, such as whether a player of his record would be likely to be considered by a Professional Golfers' Association as a tournament player, without losing his Amateur Status.

  If an amateur golfer is able to become a professional tournament player simply by successful application, he forfeits his Amateur Status when he makes a formal application to become a tournament player, even if the application is turned down. The breach occurs when he posts the application.</p></div>

An amateur golfer who fails to do so is in breach of the Rules. Otherwise, the breach occurs when, having qualified, he accepts an offer of, or applies for, membership. An acceptable form of wording for a waiver is as follows: </p></div>

    <span class="q_initial">A. </span>No. An amateur golfer forfeits his Amateur Status only when he participates in a qualifying competition to become a professional tournament player without first waiving his right in writing to any prize money. Therefore, an amateur golfer who enters such a competition without first waiving his right to prize money remains eligible to play in amateur competitions before the qualifying compe6tition, provided he conforms to the Rules (e.g., he does not identify himself as a professional golfer).
