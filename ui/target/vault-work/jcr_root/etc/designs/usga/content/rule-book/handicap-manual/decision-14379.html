If a player uses a Distance-Measuring Device to measure distance, or uses a Multi-Functional Device to access weather reports provided by weather stations through an application or Internet browser, the player is not participating in the specific act of gauging or measuring variable conditions that might affect a player's play as is prohibited under Rule 14-3 of "The Rules of Golf," and the score is acceptable for handicap purposes.
However, if a player uses the device or information available through an application or Internet browser to gauge or measure other conditions that might affect a player's play as is prohibited under Rule 14-3 of "The Rules of Golf" (e.g., through use of an anemometer, or a thermometer), the score is unacceptable for handicap purposes.

              <span class="s9">A:</span> Due to the ease of use of the Internet, the USGA believes that golf clubs and Handicap Committees can implement a positive Internet score posting component. Adopting Internet score posting requires that the golf club display scoring records of all members over the Internet as well. This may improve an aspect of peer review by giving members better ability to view other members' scores at any time.

              <span class="s9">A:</span> The player should post the actual scores on the post-match holes. To post in any other manner would be at odds with the basic premise that contends that each player will try to make the best scores at every hole in every round.

              <span class="s9">A:</span> The USGA recommends that the following method be used to combine nine-hole scores in a Round Robin format or in other events when the format requires 27 holes or multiple individual nines: The first two nines played on any day are combined to form an 18-hole score. The third nine is posted as a nine-hole score and becomes a part of the scoring record when combined with another nine-hole score.</p></div>
            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">An exception would occur if, for example, a player plays 27 holes in one day, and the first nine is a practice round.
