  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">General</h3>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">An "<em><a href="rule-14331.html#AmateurGolfer">amateur golfer</a></em>," whether he plays competitively or recreationally, is one who plays golf for the challenge it presents, not as a profession and not for financial gain.  </p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">Excessive financial incentive in amateur golf, which can result from some forms of gambling or wagering, could give rise to abuse of the Rules both in play and in manipulation of handicaps to the detriment of the integrity of the game.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">There is a distinction between playing for prize money (Rule <a href="rule-03.html#3-1">3-1</a>), gambling or wagering that is contrary to the purpose of the <em><a href="rule-14331.html#RuleorRules">Rules</a></em> (Rule <a href="rule-07.html#7-2">7-2</a>), and forms of gambling or wagering that do not, of themselves, breach the <em><a href="rule-14331.html#RuleorRules">Rules</a></em>. An <em><a href="rule-14331.html#AmateurGolfer">amateur golfer</a></em> or a <em><a href="rule-14331.html#Committee">Committee</a></em> in charge of a competition where <em><a href="rule-14331.html#AmateurGolfer">amateur golfers</a></em> are competing should consult with the <em><a href="rule-14331.html#GoverningBody">Governing Body</a></em> if in any doubt as to the application of the
<em><a href="rule-14331.html#RuleorRules">Rules</a></em>. In the absence of such guidance, it is recommended that no cash prizes be awarded so as to ensure that the <em><a href="rule-14331.html#RuleorRules">Rules</a></em> are upheld.</p></div>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">Acceptable Forms of Gambling</h3>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">There is no objection to informal gambling or wagering among individual golfers or teams of golfers when it is incidental to the game. It is not practicable to define informal gambling or wagering precisely, but features that would be consistent with such gambling or wagering include:</p></div>
  <ul>
    <li>the players in general know each other;</li>
    <li>participation in the gambling or wagering is optional and is limited to the players;</li>
    <li>the sole source of all money won by the players is advanced by the players; and</li>
    <li>the amount of money involved is not generally considered to be excessive.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">Therefore, informal gambling or wagering is acceptable provided the primary purpose is the playing of the game for enjoyment, not for financial gain.</p></div>
  <h3 class="rule-book__content__box__title">Unacceptable Forms of Gambling</h3>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">Other forms of gambling or wagering where there is a requirement for players to participate (e.g., compulsory sweepstakes) or that have the potential to involve considerable sums of money (e.g., calcuttas and auction sweepstakes - where players or teams are sold by auction) are not approved.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">Otherwise, it is difficult to define unacceptable forms of gambling or wagering precisely, but features that would be consistent with such gambling or wagering include:</p></div>
  <ul>
    <li>participation in the gambling or wagering is open to non-players; and</li>
    <li>the amount of money involved is generally considered to be excessive.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">An <em><a href="rule-14331.html#AmateurGolfer">amateur golfer's</a></em> participation in gambling or wagering that is not approved may be considered contrary to the purpose of the <em><a href="rule-14331.html#RuleorRules">Rules</a></em> (Rule <a href="rule-07.html#7-2">7-2</a>) and may endanger his Amateur Status.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">Furthermore, organized events designed or promoted to create cash prizes are not permitted. Golfers participating in such events without first irrevocably waiving their right to prize money are deemed to be playing for prize money, in breach of Rule <a href="rule-03.html#3-1">3-1</a>.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">
    <strong>Note:</strong> The Rules of Amateur Status do not apply to betting or gambling by <em><a href="rule-14331.html#AmateurGolfer">amateur golfers</a></em> on the results of a competition limited to or specifically organized for professional golfers.</p></div>
