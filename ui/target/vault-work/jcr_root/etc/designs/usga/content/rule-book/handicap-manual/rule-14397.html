Newly constructed courses change rapidly in the first few years and must be re-rated within five years. An established course must be re-rated at least every 10 years, even if it has not been changed in any way. A course must no longer use its <em><a href="rule-14370.html#USGACourseRating">USGA Course Rating</a></em> and <em><a href="rule-14370.html#Slope Rating">Slope Rating</a></em> if its ratings are more than 10 years old and scores recorded on that course may not be posted to a player's scoring record.

          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">A course rating team should be composed of at least three trained and experienced individuals. A rating team may be assisted by a club representative, preferably a player with a low <em><a href="rule-14370.html#HandicapIndex">Handicap Index</a></em> (or the club professional), who can inform the team of any unusual course conditions, including wind. Team members should have a practical knowledge of <em><a href="rule-14370.html#ScratchGolfer">scratch golfers</a></em>. Keeping the members of the team as permanent as possible helps to keep the ratings consistent.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">One member of the team must be designated by the <em><a href="rule-14370.html#authorizedgolfassociation">authorized golf association</a></em> as the team leader. The team leader must have attended a <br />course rating seminar conducted by the USGA. The team evaluates each obstacle on each hole on a scale of 0 through 10 and should attempt to agree, within one number, on the evaluation for each obstacle. If an agreement is not reached, the opinion of the team leader should prevail. While rating a course, team members may hit shots to assist them in evaluating obstacles.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">It is recommended that the team play the course before or after the rating to substantiate the rating results. The team leader must submit completed rating forms to the <em><a href="rule-14370.html#authorizedgolfassociation">authorized golf association</a></em> for review by the course rating review Committee. This Committee may modify the results within specified limits, or it may direct a re-rating by another rating team.
