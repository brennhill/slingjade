  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">The purpose of Rule <a href="rule-03.html#3-3">3-3</a> is to allow a competitor to avoid a penalty when he is in doubt as to the proper procedure. The following are guidelines for determining the ball with which the competitor scores in various situations:</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic-B">1.	If both balls are played in accordance with the Rules, the ball selected counts if the competitor announces in advance his decision to invoke this Rule and announces in advance the ball with which he wishes to score. If the competitor does not announce or select in advance, the score with the original ball counts if played in accordance with the Rules. Otherwise the score with the second ball counts if played in accordance with the Rules.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic-B">2.	If the procedure with the ball selected in advance is not in accordance with the Rules, the other ball must count if it was played in accordance with the Rules (see Decision <a href="decision-03.html#d3-3-5">3-3/5</a>).</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic-B">3.	If neither ball is played in accordance with the Rules, the following applies:</p></div>
  <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
    <li>In a case where the competitor plays both balls from a wrong place but is not guilty of a serious breach with either ball, the score with the original ball counts, with an additional penalty under the applicable Rule (see Rule <a href="rule-20.html#20-7c">20-7c</a>).</li>
    <li>In a case where the competitor is guilty of a serious breach with one ball and not guilty of a serious breach with the other ball, the score with the other ball counts, with an additional penalty under the applicable Rule (see Rule <a href="rule-20.html#20-7c">20-7c</a>).</li>
    <li>In a case where the competitor is guilty of a serious breach with both balls, the competitor is disqualified.</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic-B">4.	If the original ball is played and then Rule <a href="rule-03.html#3-3">3-3</a> is invoked, the score with the original ball must count, even if the Rules do not allow the procedure adopted for that ball, i.e., Rule <a href="rule-03.html#3-3">3-3</a> is not applicable in such circumstances (Note to Rule <a href="rule-03.html#3-3a">3-3a</a>).</p></div>

  <h4 class="q_topic">Competitor Picks Up Second Ball</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>In stroke play, a competitor, uncertain whether the road his ball lies on is an obstruction or not, invokes Rule <a href="rule-03.html#3-3">3-3</a>. He plays his original ball as it lies on the road and a second ball under Rule <a href="rule-24.html#24-2b(i)">24-2b(i)</a>, telling his marker he wishes his score with the second ball to count if the Rules permit. Having hit his original ball onto the green and the second ball into a bunker, the competitor picks up the second ball, holes out with the original ball and plays from the next tee. At this point the matter is referred to the Committee, which establishes that the road on which the competitor's ball lay was an obstruction. What is the ruling?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>Since the road on which the competitor's ball lay was an obstruction and therefore Rule <a href="rule-24.html#24-2b">24-2b</a>(i) allowed the procedure selected by the competitor, the score with the second (or selected) ball would have counted if it had been holed out. However, since the competitor did not hole out with that ball, he is disqualified (Rule <a href="rule-03.html#3-2">3-2</a>).</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">If, on the other hand, the road had not been an obstruction, there would have been no penalty. In that case, since the Rules would not have allowed the selected procedure, a score with the second ball would not have counted, and the competitor's score with his original ball would have been his score for the hole. There is no penalty for picking up a ball played under Rule <a href="rule-03.html#3-3">3-3</a> if that ball cannot count.</p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>In a match between A and B, A was unsure of his rights at a hole. Neither A nor B was aware that Rule <a href="rule-03.html#3-3">3-3</a> applies only in stroke play, so A played a second ball and holed out with both balls. At the end of the round, the matter was referred to the Committee. What is the ruling?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>A second ball played in match play is a wrong ball - see Note 2 under Rule <a href="rule-02.html#2-5">2-5</a> and Definition of "Wrong Ball." Accordingly, A would have lost the hole had B claimed it under Rule <a href="rule-02.html#2-5">2-5</a> before either player had played from the next tee. However, B made no claim. Therefore, the score with A's original ball counts.</p></div>

    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>Are there any circumstances under which a competitor in stroke play, who is doubtful of his rights or procedure, may play a third ball under Rule <a href="rule-03.html#3-3">3-3</a>?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>No. If a competitor so proceeds, the score with the original ball or, if the original ball is not one of the balls being played, the first ball put into play shall count. If the Rules do not allow the procedure adopted for the original ball or the first ball put into play, the competitor incurs the penalty prescribed for the improper procedure.</p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>In stroke play, a competitor's ball comes to rest through the green in a deep rut which has not been defined as ground under repair by the Committee. The ball is not playable due to the rut. The competitor believes that the Committee might declare the rutted area to be ground under repair. He announces to his marker or a fellow-competitor that he will drop the ball at a spot which conforms to the procedures prescribed in both Rule <a href="rule-25.html#25-1b">25-1b</a>(i) (Ground Under Repair) and Rule <a href="rule-28.html#28c">28c</a> (Ball Unplayable), seek a ruling from the Committee before returning his score card, and accept the penalty stroke in Rule <a href="rule-28.html#28">28</a> if the Committee does not declare the rutted area to be ground under repair. Is such a procedure permissible?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
