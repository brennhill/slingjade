    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span> Within the context of the Policy on Gambling (Appendix) and Rule <a href="rule-07.html#7-2">7-2</a>, what is meant by the terms "sweepstake," "auction sweepstake" and "calcutta?"</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span> A "sweepstake" is one of the most common forms of gambling or wagering in golf in which each player has an option of placing a sum of money on himself. The same sum of money is placed by each player and the total sum collected is normally disbursed among the prize winners (assuming they have entered the sweepstake). Sweepstakes are approved provided the amount of money involved is not excessive.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">An "auction sweepstake" or "calcutta" is a form of gambling or wagering in which the players or teams are sold by auction beforehand to the highest bidder. Bidding is not restricted to the players and each player or team is generally offered the right to purchase a percentage of the bet from the successful bidder before play commences. An auction sweepstake or calcutta can often involve considerable sums of money and such gambling or wagering is considered contrary to the purpose and intent of the Rules (Rule <a href="rule-07.html#7-2">7-2</a>).

    <span class="q_initial">A.</span> No. An amateur golfer may not play golf for prize money (Rule <a title="3-1" href="rule-03.html#3-1">3-1</a>). The Policy on Gambling states that there is no objection to informal gambling or wagering among individual golfers or teams of golfers when it is incidental to the game. While it is not practicable to define informal gambling or wagering precisely, websites featuring online competitions in which anyone can participate and where money can be won, are contrary to the purpose and intent of the Rules.
