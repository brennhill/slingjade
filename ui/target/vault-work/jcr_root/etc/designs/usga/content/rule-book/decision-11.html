  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">Rule <a href="rule-11.html#11-2">11-2</a> states that before a player plays his first stroke with any ball from the teeing ground, the tee-markers are deemed to be fixed. Thereafter, Decision <a href="decision-11.html#d11-2-1">11-2/1</a> clarifies that they are obstructions and if movable, may be moved (see Definition of "Obstruction").</p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic-B">(b)	A player moves a tee-marker before or after playing a stroke from the teeing ground because, in his view, the tee-markers are too close together, too far back, aimed in the wrong direction, or some similar reason - disqualification under Rule <a href="rule-33.html#33-7">33-7</a>, unless the tee-marker is replaced before the player or any other player plays from the teeing ground, in which case the penalty is modified to loss of hole in match play or two strokes in stroke play.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic-B">(c)	A player moves a tee-marker before or after playing a stroke from the teeing ground as a result of falling over the marker - no penalty and the tee-marker should be replaced.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic-B">(d)	A player moves a tee-marker before or after playing a stroke from the teeing ground as a result of intentionally kicking it or striking it with a club - no penalty and the tee-marker should be replaced.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic-B">(e)	A player lifts a tee-marker before or after playing a stroke from the teeing ground for no apparent reason and without authority under the Rules - no penalty and the tee-marker should be replaced.</p></div>

Before playing their second shots they realized their mistake, returned to the 12th tee and completed the round. On reporting the incident the competitors were each penalized two strokes, as the Committee interpreted the "next teeing ground" referred to in Rule <a href="rule-11.html#11-4b">11-4b</a> to be that of the 12th hole.

    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>In a stroke-play competition, the Committee failed to place a sign at each teeing ground indicating the hole number. As a result, a group which had just finished the 4th hole played from the teeing ground of the 12th hole, rather than the 5th hole. Should the members of the group be penalized under Rule <a href="rule-11.html#11-4b">11-4b</a> in the circumstances?</p></div>
