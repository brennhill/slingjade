    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>'X-out' is the common name used for a golf ball that a manufacturer considers to be imperfect (usually for aesthetic reasons only, e.g., paint or printing errors) and, therefore, has crossed out the brand name.

However, in a competition where the Committee has adopted the condition that the ball the player plays must be named on the List of Conforming Golf Balls (see Note to Rule <a href="rule-05.html#5-1">5-1</a>), such a ball may not be used, even if the ball in question (without the X's or without the 'refurbished' stamp) does appear on the List.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">In most cases, 'practice' balls are simply listed, conforming golf balls that have been stamped "Practice," in the same way that golf balls often feature a club or company logo.
