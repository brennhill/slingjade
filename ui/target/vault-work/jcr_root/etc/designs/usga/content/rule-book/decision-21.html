    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>A player is asked to lift his ball, which is lying through the green or in a hazard, because the ball interferes with the play of another player. The player authorizes the caddie to lift the ball and, having marked its position and lifted the ball, the caddie throws the ball to the player who catches it. Except when the ball lies on the putting green, it is not permissible to clean a ball lifted because of interference. Does the act of throwing and catching the ball constitute cleaning it?</p></div>

    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>A player lifted his ball for identification purposes without announcing his intention to his opponent, marker or a fellow-competitor. Thus, he was in breach of Rule <a href="rule-12.html#12-2">12-2</a>. He also failed to mark the position of the ball before he lifted it in breach of Rule <a href="rule-20.html#20-1">20-1</a> and cleaned the ball more than was necessary for it to be identified, a breach of Rule <a href="rule-21.html#21">21</a>. The penalty for breach of each of these Rules is one stroke. Does the player incur a penalty of three strokes?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>No. The player incurs a penalty of one stroke for failing to act in accordance with Rule <a href="rule-12.html#12-2">12-2</a>. An additional penalty under Rule <a href="rule-20.html#20-1">20-1</a> or Rule 21 is not justified - see Rule <a href="rule-12.html#12-2">12-2</a> and Exception under Rule <a href="rule-21.html#21">21</a>.</p></div>

    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>A piece of mud adheres to a player's ball. The player lifts the ball under a Rule which does not permit cleaning. When he replaces the ball, may he place it facing another direction so that the mud would not interfere between the clubface and the ball?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>Yes, provided the ball is replaced on the spot from which it was lifted. However, if the player rotated the ball in such a way so as to "tee" it on the mud, he would be in breach of Rule <a href="rule-20.html#20-3a">20-3a</a>.</p></div>
