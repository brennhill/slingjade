          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The vast majority of people who play golf assume that when they buy golf clubs, they conform with the Rules. To help prevent non-conforming equipment from appearing in the marketplace, the USGA offers an equipment testing and evaluation service to manufacturers, and encourages manufacturers to submit drawings, descriptions, and/or prototype samples of new product to the USGA as early in the development process as possible, prior to mass production and distribution, in order to avoid potentially costly consequences should the USGA determine that the product does not conform to the Rules of Golf. Additionally, this process helps to protect golfers from unwittingly obtaining non-conforming equipment for use under the Rules of Golf. While this procedure works most of the time, there are occasions when non-conforming equipment is sold in the marketplace. That, combined with the fact that many golfers like to make their own modifications to clubs (see section below on Wear and Alteration), makes the Guide an important tool for all concerned.</p></div>

Additionally, on very rare occasion, a new or modified Rule can render existing equipment non-conforming.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>As a result, it is the player's responsibility to ensure that his clubs conform to the Rules.

For example, a grip may become so worn that it becomes molded for the hands, or the grooves on an iron club may become so worn that they no longer conform to the requirements in Appendix II, 5c.</p></div>

          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>This means that a club which conformed when new cannot be rendered non-conforming due to wear through normal use. However, a club which did not conform to the Rules when new cannot be worn into a conforming state. Such a club would always be considered non-conforming. Wear is defined as the erosion of material. Damage, on the other hand, is usually caused by a single occurrence. Generally, material decomposition or deterioration is not considered wear.</p></div>

Permanent attachments or coatings such as plasma spray, "balata"-type rubber or even paint are dealt with under the club face Rules in Appendix II (see Section 5).</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The most important question to ask when ruling on a club which has had something temporarily applied to the face by a player is "why has it been put there?" If a material or substance has been applied to the face in order to protect it or to clean it, then it would probably be permitted provided all other Rules are satisfied. However, if the purpose of the application is to influence the movement of the ball or to assist the player in making a stroke, it would be prohibited. Any type of tape or similar material added to the face is not permitted for any purpose.</p></div>
