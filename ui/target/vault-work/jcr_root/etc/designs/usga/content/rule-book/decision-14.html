  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>A ball was at rest in shallow, rapidly-running water in a water hazard. After the player had carefully entered the water, walked to the ball and taken his stance, the ball moved, presumably due to the current. What is the ruling?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>When a ball is in water in a water hazard and it is not clear whether the player's actions caused the ball to move, he should be given the benefit of the doubt and no penalty should be applied. However, if the player's actions clearly caused the ball to move, he would be subject to a penalty stroke under Rule <a href="rule-18.html#18-2a">18-2a</a> and required to replace the ball. For example, if a player jumped into the water close to the ball and in so doing created a splash that moved the ball, he would be subject to penalty under Rule <a href="rule-18.html#18-2a">18-2a</a>.</p></div>
