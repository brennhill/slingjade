          <b>Appendix G Golf Club Audit Procedure </b>
        </p></div>
        <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">The USGA has initiated an audit program for golf clubs to ensure the integrity of the USGA Handicap System. All licensed golf clubs are subject to being audited by the USGA, regardless of whether there is a compliance item in question.</p></div>
        <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">Any licensed golf club that is reported to the USGA in writing as having a potential compliance issue is immediately subject to an audit.</p></div>
        <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">If an audited golf club does not satisfy the audit process, the USGA will send a letter stating the non-conforming issues. A time limit will be set for the club to cure its deficiencies or run the risk of being dropped from the authorized golf club list located at <span class="s4"><i><a href="/" target="">www.usga.org</a>,</i></span> including losing its ability to utilize the USGA Handicap System. </p></div>
        <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p22Appendix">
          <b>Enforcement Procedure</b>
        </p></div>
        <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">The USGA will ask an authorized golf association in the area to contact the club about compliance. If neither that association nor the USGA is able to persuade the golf club to comply, the USGA will advise the club in writing that the club may not utilize the USGA Handicap System and may not use USGA trademarks in any manner.</p></div>
        <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">The club will be withdrawn from the list of golf clubs authorized to utilize the USGA Handicap System. The USGA reserves the right to inform others that the club's right to utilize the USGA Handicap System has been withdrawn. </p></div>
        <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p22Appendix">
          <b>Appeal Process</b>
        </p></div>
        <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">If a golf club is dissatisfied with the initial decision, it may appeal to the USGA Handicap Committee by sending written notice to the USGA within 30 days after being notified of the loss of its ability to utilize the USGA Handicap System. If the golf club elects to appeal, its representative must be given reasonable notice of that Committee's next meeting at which the matter is to be heard, and will be entitled to present its case. The USGA Handicap Committee will issue a final decision on the matter using all information provided by the golf club together with the findings and recommendations of the staff. </p></div>
        <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p22Appendix">
          <b>Reinstatement Policy and Procedure</b>
        </p></div>
        <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">A golf club that has lost the privilege of utilizing the USGA Handicap System will be required to apply for reinstatement of that privilege and resubmit an application for a license agreement. Upon receipt of the completed application, the USGA will provide a list of requirements that need to be satisfied in order for the application to be considered. Upon the golf club satisfying the USGA that these requirements have been met, the USGA will notify the golf club and all parties that were previously notified of the club's non-compliance that the club is again eligible to utilize the USGA Handicap System. However, the reinstated golf club is subject to the audit process during each of the next two years.</p></div>
