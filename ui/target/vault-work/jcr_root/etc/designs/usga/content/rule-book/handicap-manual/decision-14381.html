Complete scoring records are available on these sites to fellow club members, the club Handicap Committee, and competition officials of any competition in which the player is going to participate. Is this a violation of the player's right of privacy?</p></div>
            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">
              <span class="s9">A:</span> No. An essential part of the USGA Handicap System, which includes a Handicap Index, is peer review, and scoring records which includes a Handicap Index list are available for inspection by others, including, but not limited to, fellow members and the club's Handicap Committee. Once a golfer decides to obtain a Handicap Index, the golfer consents to the practice and procedures of the Handicap System, which includes permitting access to this information, and there can be no expectation of privacy with respect to information as to which others will have access.

            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">
              <span class="s9">A: </span>"Readily available" means easy access to this information. If the sole place where posted scores, scoring records, and a Handicap Index list are kept is in a home, behind a golf shop counter, or in some other area where others cannot access this information easily, these requirements are not being satisfied. If all members of a golf club have Internet access, maintaining a club Web site via the Internet with a distinctive Web site address that displays posted scores, scoring records, and a Handicap Index list will meet these requirements. Using a member's identification number as the sole means of accessing that member's information is not considered making records readily available; some additional means, such as a name search feature, must be offered. </p></div>

The additional conditions are as follows:</p></div>
