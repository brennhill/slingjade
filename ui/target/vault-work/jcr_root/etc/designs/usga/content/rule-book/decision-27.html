  <h4 class="q_topic">Provisional Ball Not Distinguishable from Original Ball</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">A player entitled to play a provisional ball from the tee plays it into the same area as his original ball. The balls have identical markings and the player cannot distinguish between them. Following are various situations and the solutions, which are based on equity (Rule <a href="rule-01.html#1-4">1-4</a>), when the above circumstances exist and one or both of the balls are found within a search of five minutes:</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">
    <strong>Situation 1:</strong>One ball is found in a water hazard and the other ball is not found.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">
    <strong>Solution 1:</strong>The ball that was found must be presumed to be the provisional ball.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">
    <strong>Situation 2:</strong>Both balls are found in a water hazard.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">
    <strong>Solution 2:</strong>As the player's original ball is lost in the water hazard due to his inability to identify it (see analogous Decision <a href="decision-27.html#d27-10">27/10</a>), the player must proceed under Rule <a href="rule-26.html#26-1">26-1</a> with respect to the original ball (estimating the spot where the ball last crossed the margin of the hazard, if necessary - see Decision 26-1/17); his next stroke would be his third.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">
    <strong>Situation 3:</strong>One ball is found in bounds and the other ball is lost or is found out of bounds.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">
    <strong>Solution 3:</strong>The ball in bounds must be presumed to be the provisional ball.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">
    <strong>Situation 4:</strong>Both balls are found in bounds, whether in a playable or an unplayable lie, and (1) one ball is in a water hazard and the other is not or (2) both balls lie through the green or in a bunker.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">
    <strong>Solution 4:</strong>One could argue that both balls are lost. However, it would be inequitable to require the player to return to the tee, playing 5, when the player has found both balls but does not know which is the original and which the provisional. Accordingly, the player must select one of the balls, treat it as his provisional ball and abandon the other.</p></div>

    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>At a par-3 hole, a player hits his tee shot into dense woods. He then hits a provisional ball which comes to rest near the hole. In view of the position of the provisional ball, the player does not wish to find his original ball. He does not search for it and walks directly towards his provisional ball to continue play with it. His opponent (or fellow-competitor) believes it would be beneficial to him if the original ball were found. May the opponent (or fellow-competitor) search for the player's ball?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>Yes. In equity (Rule 1-4), he may search for five minutes provided that in the meantime the player does not play a stroke with the provisional ball, it being nearer the hole than the place where the original ball is likely to be. The player is entitled to play such a stroke. If he does, the original ball is then lost under Rule 27-2b and further search for it would serve no purpose. In match play, if the player so proceeds and his provisional ball is closer to the hole than his opponent's ball, his opponent may recall the stroke (Rule 10-1c). However, recalling the stroke would not change the status of the original ball, which was lost when the provisional ball was played out of turn.
