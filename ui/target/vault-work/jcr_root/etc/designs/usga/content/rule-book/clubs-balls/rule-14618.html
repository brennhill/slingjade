The point where the shaft ceases to be straight can be determined by placing a rigid steel ruler along the straight part of the shaft and identifying the point where the shaft and the ruler are no longer in contact. This rule is particularly relevant for putters where the shaft is inserted directly into the head. (For putter heads with "necks," see Design of Clubs, Section 2c.)</p></div>

          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>This Rule effectively restricts shafts from being designed to have asymmetric properties, so that however the club is assembled, or whichever way the shaft is oriented, it will make no difference to the performance of the club.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>However, many graphite shafts have a small "spine" running along the length of the shaft which may make them bend differently depending on how they are fitted to the head. As previously noted, the USGA recognizes that it is difficult for manufacturers to consistently produce a perfectly symmetrical shaft and, provided that the shaft is manufactured with the intention of meeting the above requirements, the USGA may incorporate a reasonable tolerance when evaluating shafts for conformance. Additionally, manufacturers of clubs may orient or align shafts which have spines for uniformity in assembling sets, or in an effort to make the shafts perform as if they were perfectly symmetrical. However, a shaft which has been oriented for the purpose of influencing the performance of a club, e.g., to correct wayward shots, would be contrary to the intent of this Rule.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>It's difficult to assess the conformance of a shaft in the field. A standard shaft with a circular cross-section would most likely conform to the Rules unless there is evidence to the contrary (e.g., claims by the manufacturer which would indicate non-conformance, including advertising claims). However, a shaft which is not symmetrical in cross-section, such as an oval or rectangular shaft, would not normally be expected to conform to the Rules. Manufacturers of shafts with unique cross-sections should submit them to the USGA early in the development process, prior to production and marketing.</p></div>

          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The most important points to remember here are that a club must only have one neck, that it must be "plain", and, in order to restrict elaborate shapes and curves, the length of the neck is limited to 5 inches (127 mm). This measurement should be made in the same way as a bend in the bottom of a shaft (see Design of Clubs, Section 2a).</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The majority of necks are designed to have the shaft inserted into them, and this normally avoids any confusion as to where the neck begins. However, if the neck is inserted into the shaft, the measurement should be taken from the end of the shaft.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The interpretation of a "plain" neck has recently been clarified as follows:</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
            <b>All Clubs</b> </p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The neck must not be shaped for any purpose, other than connecting the shaft to the head in a traditional manner. While a neck may contain features such as an adjustability mechanism, a method for damping vibration or an alignment line, it must not be unusually shaped in order to house or accomodate such a feature. For example, in most cases, lines which have been painted or lightly engraved onto an otherwise plain neck are permitted. However, a neck designed specifically to accomodate such lines or marks would be considered non-conforming. Small scale features, on an otherwise plain neck, which are purely for decorative purposes, and could not effectively perform, or be used for, another purpose, may also be permitted.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>
            <b>Woods</b> </p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The above requirements also apply to woods. However, there is some accomodation for the transition area between the head of a wood and its neck. This transistion area must fit within a cylinder of a diameter and height of 1 inch (25.4 mm) measured from the base of the transition and parallel to the axis of the shaft. Any transition which satisfies this restriction should be permitted provided it does not contain any other non-plain feature (for example, holes or alignment bars).</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>NOTE: Some exceptions may be made for clubheads made of wood. Ferrules shaped to circumvent this interpretation are not permitted.</p></div>
          <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Figure 12 contains diagrams of various neck features which would not be considered "plain," such as a putter which has multiple necks and a putter with a neck which is too long.</p></div>
