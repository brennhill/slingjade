              <span class="s9">Q:</span> In the definition of Handicap Committee, it states that an employee may not serve as Handicap Chairperson. Is the owner of a golf club considered an employee? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Or an employee of a third party that assists in the operation <br />of a golf club? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Or an employee of a municipality that owns/operates a golf course?</p></div>

              <span class="s9">A:</span> In each of these cases, as well as that of a club professional, the person referenced is in a position where pleasing club members is a key responsibility. This makes it difficult for such a person to play an impartial role. These "employees" are not eligible to chair the Handicap Committee of a golf club where they are "employed."  </p></div>

            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">
              <span class="s9">A:</span> No. Any individual that receives payment or compensation for performing the duties of a member of the Handicap Committee, including the Handicap Chairperson, is deemed to be an employee and as such is not eligible to serve as the Handicap Chairperson. Compensation or what the USGA considers the equivalent to compensation, puts someone in a position to act like an employee, similar to Decision <a href="decision-14385.html#8-1/1">8-1/1</a>. This includes, but is not limited to compensation based on a percentage of revenue, paying travel expenses, deriving financial benefit from increased usage of a course, commissions, incentives, etc. A Handicap Chairperson or Committee member may receive a nominal benefit for services rendered, such as waiving the annual membership fee, annual green fees or complimentary use of the club's practice facilities.</p></div>

              <span class="s9">Q:</span> Is the handicap license of a golf club subject to revocation solely because its representative at a USGA Handicap System Seminar is no longer part of the club? </p></div>
            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">
              <span class="s9">A:</span> No. If a club representative has participated in a seminar and passed a test exhibiting knowledge about the USGA Handicap System at some point during the term of the license, this requirement is considered to be met through the end of the current term. However, each golf club is encouraged always to have at least one active club representative who has met this requirement. An authorized golf association may have its own requirement that a member club continuously has a club representative who has attended a seminar and passed a test in order for the club to receive certain association membership benefits, but such a requirement does not impact the club's ability to be licensed to utilize the USGA Handicap System. </p></div>
            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">In addition, if the representative of Club A joins Club B, which is in need of the seminar and quiz requirement, this will be considered to have been met for Club B. The club's Handicap Chairperson or a club official should contact the authorized golf association and/or the USGA to update its records when this occurs. (REVISED)</p></div>

              <span class="s9">A:</span> A revised Handicap Index list should be posted on the revision date. The period of time a revised Handicap Index list is held before it is posted should be minimized through coordination with the computation service. (REVISED)</p></div>

The player has started to play again, but due to recovery and fatigue, the player's three latest scores have been 104, 100, and 102. May the player receive a special adjustment while recovering?</p></div>
            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">
              <span class="s9">A: </span>The player is entitled to a special adjustment under Section <a href="rule-14385.html#8-4">8-4c(iii)</a>. The player should be assigned a temporary local handicap (L) to reflect current ability, as needed during the temporary disability, and it must be identified by the letter "L" to indicate that it is for local use only.

Neither will ever be able to play to the Handicap Index established before illness. May these players be entitled to a special adjustment?</p></div>
            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">
              <span class="s9">A: </span>Yes. The disabilities described appear to be permanent and more extensive than contemplated by Section <a href="rule-14385.html#8-4">8-4c(iii)</a>.</p></div>
            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">The club Handicap Committee may discard the players' previous scoring records and provide each with a local handicap for use until five scores have been returned to establish a new Handicap Index.</p></div>

            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">
              <span class="s9">Q: </span>Almost every year, a player scores very well (or poorly) during a certain season in comparison to the previous season and the player's Handicap Index changes. The player suggests that this change in scoring is the result of seasonal changes in course conditions. May the Handicap Committee make an adjustment to the player's Handicap Index for this reason?</p></div>
            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">
              <span class="s9">A: </span>Yes. Changing course conditions by themselves, do not influence a player's potential ability and should not result in a change to a Handicap Index. If the Handicap Committee believes that the player's potential ability is different than the Handicap Index calculated from scores, it is authorized to adjust the player's Handicap Index.</p></div>
            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">If this sort of change in scoring is widespread because of changes in course conditions and the Handicap Committee believes it is not practical to maintain course difficulty consistent with its ratings it should consider suspending posting, but must obtain approval from the authorized golf association that issued its ratings if this suspension is to be for an extended period of time.</p></div>
