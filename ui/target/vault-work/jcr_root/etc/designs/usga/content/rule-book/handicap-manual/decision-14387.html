If the Committee requires that players base their handicaps on scores limited to four local courses, these players would not be using a Handicap Index and could not term the handicap a Handicap Index. The USGA Handicap System requires players to return all scores, regardless of where they were made.

The USGA does not recommend prohibiting a player whose Handicap Index is based on fewer than ten scores from the competition because the Handicap Index that is based on fewer than ten scores is just as valid as a Handicap Index that is based on ten or more scores. Furthermore, a player whose Handicap Index is computed from fewer than ten scores has no advantage over other players. (See Section <a href="rule-14391.html#11-4">11-4</a>.)</p></div>

On holes allocated 14, 15, 16, and 17, A will receive strokes and B will not. A will have a greater chance of winning those holes.
