  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic">(1)	A concedes the match, a hole, or a stroke to C but stipulates that the concession is solely for their singles match. The concession is not valid in the four-ball match.</p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic">(3)	A concedes the match, a hole, or a stroke to D. The concession applies only to the four-ball match as A has no authority to make a concession in the B-D singles match.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic">(4)	The balls of all four players lie on the putting green and A's ball is the farthest from the hole with B's ball on the same line. Side C-D concedes B's next stroke for the four-ball match only, but B goes ahead and putts before A.

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic">(7)	On the 3rd hole it is discovered that B started his round with 15 clubs.

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text_arabic">(9)	On the 5th hole, B holes out in 3 to win the hole for Side A-B in the four-ball match. A has a putt left to win or halve the hole in his singles match against C and asks B for advice. There is no penalty to either player. A and B may exchange advice at any time until the four-ball match has been concluded, at which point A and B are no longer partners and become outside agencies with respect to each other.</p></div>

    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>In four-ball play, A and B are partners. A hits his tee shot out of bounds and decides not to complete play of the hole. B was undecided on club selection for his second shot, so A drops a ball near B's ball and hits a shot towards the green. What penalties were incurred?</p></div>

    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>Since the side, i.e., both A and B, had not completed the play of the hole,A was practicing during play of the hole and thus was in breach of Rule <a href="rule-07.html#7-2">7-2</a>.</p></div>

    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>In a four-ball match, A practices chip shots to the 18th green between play of the 9th and 10th holes. Thus, A is disqualified for the 10th hole under Rule <a href="rule-07.html#7-2">7-2</a>. If A plays the 10th hole, is B, A's partner, also subject to disqualification for the 10th hole if A's play of the hole assists B, e.g., with regard to club selection?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>Since A was disqualified for the 10th hole, the strokes played by him on that hole were practice strokes. Therefore, A was in breach of Rule 7-2 each time he played a stroke on the 10th and, if B was assisted by any such stroke, B incurred the applicable penalty.</p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>In four-ball match play, A and B are partners. In playing his own ball, B accidentally strikes the nearby ball of A with his club and causes it to move. What is the procedure?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">If A's ball was visible when B made his stroke, it was reasonably foreseeable that B's stroke at his own ball could cause A's ball to move and, through exercising reasonable care by having A's ball lifted under Rule <a href="rule-22.html#22-2">22-2</a>, B could have avoided causing A's ball to move. In such circumstances, A incurs a one-stroke penalty under Rule <a href="rule-18.html#18-2a">18-2a</a> and must replace his ball.
