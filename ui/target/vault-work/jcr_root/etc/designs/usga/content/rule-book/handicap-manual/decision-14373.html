In a competition with a field of 100 players, in which 88 are playing the back tees and 12 are playing the forward tees, instead of adding the difference in USGA Course Rating to the Course Handicap of each of the 88 players, could the Committee subtract it from the Course Handicap of the 12 players playing the lower-rated set of tees?</p></div>

A and B compete in a match and, based on the handicap allowance from Section <a href="rule-14387.html#9-4">9-4a(i)</a>, B receives 8 strokes, the difference between 31 and 23. B wins the match, 1 up. A questions B's handicap; B admits to not adjusting hole scores under the Equitable Stroke Control provision of the USGA Handicap System. It is determined that if B had adjusted hole scores using ESC, Course Handicap would be 29 strokes. The Committee disqualifies B under Rule 6-2a. Was the Committee correct? </p></div>

              <span class="s9">A:</span> Rule 6-2a of "The Rules of Golf," acknowledges that: "Before starting a match in a handicap competition, the players should determine from one another their respective handicaps. If a player begins the match having declared a higher handicap which would affect the number of strokes given or received, the player is disqualified; otherwise, the player plays off the declared handicap." </p></div>
            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">B's Course Handicap, although incorrect due to the player's failure to apply Equitable Stroke Control, was 31. Accordingly, B was not in breach of Rule 6-2a and the match should have stood as played. </p></div>
            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">
              <span class="s11">As it is impractical for a Committee conducting a competition to determine whether a player has correctly recorded each score, turned in all scores, etc., for handicap purposes, the Rules of Golf assume that the player has done so. The solution to a situation such as this is for the Handicap Committee to take appropriate action against B under Section <a href="rule-14385.html#8-4">8-4c</a> of the USGA Handicap System manual because of the player's failure to apply Equitable Stroke Control to the scores the player returned for handicap purposes. </span>
