                <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>The grip is principally for the purpose of assisting the player in obtaining a firm hold - so that the club does not slip or twist out of the player's hand. However, the installation of a grip is optional.</p></div>

                  <span style="COLOR: rgb(42,73,141)">When no material is added to the part of the shaft designed to be held by the player, the Rules relating to the grip take precedence over the Rules relating to the shaft.</span> Therefore, the dimensions and cross-section of that area of the shaft may change and equal bending in any direction would not be required (see Design of Clubs, Section 2b).</p></div>

                  <span style="COLOR: rgb(42,73,141)">In order to accommodate both hands, the grip must be at least seven inches (177.8 mm) in length. This also applies to clubs which have been designed to be used one-handed. </span>For putters with two grips, see The Grip, Section 3c.</p></div>
                <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Due to the nature of grips and the Rules regulating them, it is sometimes very difficult to make a ruling without examining and comparing examples of other grips which are known to either conform or not conform. However, this is not something which would normally be possible in the field. It may help to remember that the overall consideration is that a grip "must not be molded for any part of the hands." If a certain feature on the grip enables the player to place his hands in exactly the same position every time, solely by feel and without actually looking at the grip, then it must be determined whether that feature renders the grip "molded for the hands." An extreme example of a grip which would be ruled "molded for the hands" is the type of "training grip" often used to help beginners. However, a grip which has subtle changes in surface texture would usually be considered conforming. Likewise, printed markings which assist with the correct placement of the hands visually would normally be considered conforming. Most of the details contained in Design of Clubs, Sections 3b and 3c serve to clarify and expand on this basic principle.</p></div>

                <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Grips on woods and iron clubs are allowed to deviate from circular by having a slightly raised rib running along the full length of the grip (often called a "reminder rib").</p></div>

Additionally, the dimension of the rib width, from edge to edge, should not exceed 50% of the grip's internal diameter. </span>While the first measurement can be taken using a pair of calipers, due to the nature of gripping materials, caution should be taken in making decisions in the field.</p></div>

                  <span style="COLOR: rgb(42,73,141)">In the case of a standard length grip (approximately 10 inches (254 mm) in length), the "full length of the grip" is interpreted to mean that the rib must extend to within 3 inches (76.2 mm) of the tip. This is generally regarded as enough to cover the span of the player's hands on the grip (see Figure 13).</span> </p></div>

                  <span style="COLOR: rgb(42,73,141)">Simulated leather wrapped grips molded out of a rubber-like material with an indented spiral surface pattern or other similar indentations are permitted, as long as the fingers cannot comfortably fit in between the spirals or indentations. Also, features such as lines, dots, or other patterned indentations, which are too small to fit even the smallest of fingers, would not of themselves cause a grip to be in breach of the Rules. Such features would not normally render a grip non-circular in cross-section (for irons and woods) or not generally similar throughout the length of the grip (putters).</span> </p></div>

It also requires that the axis of the grip and shaft must coincide.

For this reason, putters which have two grips must have two circular grips and this is interpreted strictly to mean that the grips must not incorporate a reminder rib.</p></div>
                <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p>Where a putter has two grips, these grips are only considered "separate" if the gap between them is at least 1.5 inches (38.1 mm) in length. If such a gap does not exist, the total length from the bottom of the lower "grip" to the top of the upper one is considered "one grip." Therefore, in both of the instances mentioned above, it is unlikely that the grip would conform if two conventional grips were used. Either the exposed piece of shaft between the two "grips" would constitute a waist, or the fact that two grips met in the middle would cause a bulge. The second example may be overcome if the lower grip was a continuation of the top grip, that is, a continuation of the same taper (see Figure 15).</p></div>
