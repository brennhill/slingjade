              <span class="s9">A:</span> If the club's Tournament Committee has authorized the club professional to conduct the competition, they have determined the selection of the winner(s) will be based on stipulated round(s) and played under "The Rules of Golf" (and the Committee has announced in advance that the score be identified by the letter "T"), scores from such events may be posted as tournament scores. The timing of acceptance of entries and the nature of the prizes do not affect whether a score is a tournament score. Events such as women's or seniors' weekly play days normally are not to be designated as T-Scores because they are not significant in the traditions, schedules, formats and membership of the club.

            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">
              <span class="s9">Q:</span> Our club has a Tournament Committee that sets up weekly competitions with modest prizes but does not make pairings or post starting times. May these scores be posted as tournament scores?</p></div>
            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">
              <span class="s9">A: </span>The fact that specific starting times and pairings are not assigned in advance does not alone determine the status of a competition. The fact that prizes are modest has no bearing. (See Decision 10-3/2.) The club's Tournament Committee must decide whether any of the scores from these weekly competitions meet the definition of a tournament score for posting purposes. That is, the competition must be organized and conducted by a Committee, and the selection of the winner(s) must be based on a stipulated round(s) and it must be played under "The Rules of Golf." If so, the Committee must announce in advance that the scores must be identified by the letter "T" when posted. If the competition, in the judgment of the Handicap Committee, would identify such players, the Committee may announce that scores from the competition must be identified as tournament scores when posted. However, events such as women's or seniors' weekly play days normally are not to be designated as T-Scores because they are not significant in the traditions, schedules, formats and membership of the club. One example of a significant event is one that is scheduled to be held annually. Careful consideration should be given to the possibility that too many events identified as Tournament Scores inhibits Section <a href="rule-14389.html#10-3">10-3</a> from effectively identifying and reducing the Handicap Index of players who excel in competition.

We conduct a weekly sweep every Wednesday. The groups are made up with participants and non-participants as they arrive to play. Players entering the sweep give the Pro $2 for the prize pool. There are no posted pairings or starting times. Winners receive gift certificates equal to the prize pool of the day. Some Wednesday formats conform totally to "The Rules of Golf" and others do not. All of these scores are eligible for the annual ringers tournament. May these scores be designated as tournament scores?</p></div>
            <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="p12">
              <span class="s9">A:</span> Scores made in events which do not conform to "The Rules of Golf" generally may not be designated as tournament scores. None of the stated factors by themselves would prevent the Committee from designating scores in these competitions as tournament scores. The purpose of the tournament scores procedure is to identify players who excel in competition well beyond their current Handicap Index. If the competition, in the judgment of the Handicap Committee, would identify such players, the Committee may announce that scores from the competition must be identified as tournament scores when posted. The club Committee is best qualified to make the decision because it knows its traditions, schedules, formats, and members. However, events such as women's or men's weekly play days normally are not to be designated as T-scores because they are not significant in the traditions, schedules, formats, and membership of the club. One example of a significant event is one that is scheduled to be held annually.</p></div>
