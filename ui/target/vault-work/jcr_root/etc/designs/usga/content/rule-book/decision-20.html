  <h4 class="q_topic">Competitor's Ball Played by Fellow-Competitor; Competitor Substitutes Another Ball at Wrong Place, Plays It and Then Abandons It and Plays Out Original Ball from Right Place</h4>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">Q.</span>In stroke play, A, B and C hit their tee shots into the same area. After B and C have played their second shots, A discovers that the remaining ball is not his and, although it is clear that either B or C has played his ball, A assumes that his ball has been played by B. The final paragraph of Rule <a href="rule-15.html#15-3b">15-3b</a> requires A to place a ball on the spot from which his ball was played. A places another ball on the spot from which B played his second shot and plays it to the green. There it is discovered that it was C, not B, who wrongly played A's ball and that A has therefore played the substituted ball from a wrong place. A accepts a two-stroke penalty under the applicable Rule (Rules <a href="rule-15.html#15-3b">15-3b</a> and <a href="rule-20.html#20-7c">20-7c</a>), but he then abandons the substituted ball, thinking he must correct his error. A picks up his original ball, goes back to the spot where C played his second shot, plays it from there onto the putting green and takes two putts to hole out. A then drives from the next tee. What is the ruling, and what did A score on the hole?</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">
    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>A's procedure was correct up to the point he abandoned the substituted ball. It is a question of fact who actually played A's ball, and this fact was something that A could have determined prior to playing the substituted ball. The substituted ball, albeit played from a wrong place, was now A's ball in play, and his original ball was out of play. As A's breach was not serious, he was not required to correct the error of playing from a wrong place. Instead of abandoning the substituted ball, A should have played out the hole with it (Rule <a href="rule-13.html#13-1">13-1</a>) in accordance with Rule <a href="rule-20.html#20-7c">20-7c</a>, adding to his score the two-stroke penalty he had correctly accepted under Rule <a href="rule-15.html#15-3b">15-3b</a>.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">When A went back and played his original ball from the right place (i.e., from where C had wrongly played it), he was substituting a ball for his ball in play in breach of Rule <a href="rule-15.html#15-2">15-2</a> as well as playing from the wrong place. Therefore, he incurred an additional penalty of two strokes (Rules <a href="rule-13.html#13-1">13-1</a>, <a href="rule-15.html#15-2">15-2</a> and <a href="rule-20.html#20-7c">20-7c</a>) for a total of four penalty strokes. A's score for the hole was 9.</p></div>
