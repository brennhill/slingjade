If either of the two nine-hole scores was posted via Internet (See Section <a href="rule-14379.html#5-2">5-2a(vi)</a>), the score should be designated CI; <br /><br />(iv) Nine-hole scores are combined in the order that they are received into the player's scoring record from any club or from any combination of nines, regardless of score type. For example, a front nine middle tee score could combine with a front nine back tee score made from any course.<br /><br />An 18-hole score created by the combination of two nine-hole scores will display the date and course name (if applicable) of the latest nine hole score (e.g., April 29 and May 4 = May 4).<br /><br />A nine-hole score will be retained for combination with another nine-hole score until it is older than the twentieth oldest eighteen-hole score in the scoring record.
