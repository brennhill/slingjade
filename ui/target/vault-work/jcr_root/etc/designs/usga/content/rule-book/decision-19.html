  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text">Under the Definition of "Equipment," equipment includes a golf cart, whether or not motorized. If two or more players share a golf cart, the cart and everything in it are deemed to be the equipment of one of the players sharing the cart. If the cart is being moved by one of the players (or the partner of one of the players) sharing it, the cart and everything in it are deemed to be that player's equipment. Otherwise, the cart and everything in it are deemed to be the equipment of the player sharing the cart whose ball (or whose partner's ball) is involved.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">Thus, for example, in a singles match, if A and B are sharing a cart and A's ball in motion is deflected or stopped by the cart, A incurs a penalty of one stroke (Rule <a href="rule-19.html#19-2">19-2</a>) unless the cart is being driven or pulled by B when the incident occurs. If B is driving or pulling the cart, there is no penalty, and A would have the option of playing his ball as it lies or replaying the stroke (Rule <a href="rule-19.html#19-3">19-3</a>).</p></div>

    <span class="q_initial">A.</span>In a case where the ball might have come to rest where X was situated if he had not deliberately deflected or stopped it, the spot where X was situated should be the estimated spot for the purposes of dropping the ball in accordance with the Note.

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="q_text-indent">If there is no question that the ball would have come to rest somewhere else if X had not deflected or stopped it, a judgment must be made as to where the ball would have come to rest, and the player should be given the benefit of any doubt. For example, if no person or object had been behind X and without any doubt the ball would have come to rest either in a lateral water hazard behind the green or in the rough just short of the hazard, the estimated spot for dropping the ball should be in the rough just short of the hazard.</p></div>
