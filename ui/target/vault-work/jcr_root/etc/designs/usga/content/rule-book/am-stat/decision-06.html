    <span class="q_initial">A.</span> From an Amateur Status perspective, a disabled amateur golfer's golf skill should be determined by a Governing Body based on his ability as a golfer rather than his ability as a disabled golfer.

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">Generally, for golf reputation to be "lost" after golf skill has diminished, a period of five years must have passed since the player (a) had competitive success at a regional or national level or was selected to represent his national, regional, state or county golf union or association; or (b) competed at an elite level. In making this determination, the Governing Body should look at the standard of ability of the player and the level of competition in which the player is currently participating.</p></div>

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">

  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">For example, if the offer is made to a player who has been a member of the Club for a long period of time and has consistently represented the Club or if a player won a major tournament at the Club and the Club wishes to recognize that achievement, in these circumstances, there would be no breach of Rule <a href="rule-06.html#6-6" title="6-6">6-6</a> if the player accepted the offer.</p></div>
  <div class="rule-book__content__box__text"><p class="standardTxt">However, if an offer was made to a player of golf skill or reputation from another Club for no reason other than as an inducement to play for the Club, acceptance would constitute a breach of Rule <a href="rule-06.html">6-6</a>.
